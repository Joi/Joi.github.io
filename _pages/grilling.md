I've been doing a lot of grilling these days and the more I learn, the more I realize I don't know.

Things that I've been experimenting with these days:

- [[Binchotan]] - Japanese hardwood charcoal.
- [[Reverse Sear]] - Inspired by sous vide - grilling on low heat to get the internal temperature up slowly before finishing with a sear.
- [[Doneness]] - How do I know when my food is done?
- The [[evaporation-effect]] - why does my temperature plateau once and then start rising again. Answer: the evaporation effect.
