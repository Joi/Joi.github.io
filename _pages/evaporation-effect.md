title: Evaporation Effect
---

When meat is cooking it will hit a plateau of temperature as the evaporation cools the meat and prevents it from entering the sweet spot for roasts and braises of 180-200ºF. To get around it, heat at a higher temp like 325ºF before going down to 200ºF after it hits 180ºF.

Something that needs to be taken into account for roasting, basting as well as [[Reverse Sear]].

2. [Cook's Illustrated - How to Braise Brisket](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/552-how-to-braise-brisket) which covers the evaporation effect in the context of briskets. Solution is to blast at a higher oven temperature and lower the oven temperature as soon as the internal temperature passes the stall.
