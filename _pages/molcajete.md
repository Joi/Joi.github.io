A molcajete is a Mexican mortar and pestle. [There is an extensive Wikipedia article about molcajete.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molcajete)

It's typically made from volcanic stone and is used for grinding things and is great for guacamole.

It requires seasoning, much like cast iron skillets.

There were a bunch of different sites with a whole range of methods for seasoning, but I mashed a few together and ended up with this process:

1. Grind down dried corn
2. Grind down dried beans
3. Grind down 2 batches of dried white rice
4. Grind down soaked white rice
5. Grind a mix of cumin seeds, garlic, green onion and rock salt and allow paste to sit for 12 hours or so

After each batch of stuff, rince and dry.
