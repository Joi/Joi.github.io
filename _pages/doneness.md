title: Doneness
---
There are many ways to check for doneness and your mileage may vary, but becoming proficient at doneness is a key to cooking success. Timing helps, but with all of the variability of cooking systems, you must rely on your own tests of doneness.

### Subjective

- Jiggled **brisket** should jiggle like jello when done.
- **Pork and lamb shoulder** blade bones should pull out easily when done.
- If you can shred **pork, chicken or mutton** when doing a slow cook, it's done.
- If you can pierce **brisket or large slow cooked meat** with the handle of a wooden spoon or a (gloved) finger, it's done.
- Ribs should bend an break when done.
- The meat on ribs should shrink when done. ¼ - ½ inches for baby back ribs, ½ - 1 inches for spare ribs and 1 - 1½ inches for beef back ribs.
- Fish, such as salmon, should flake when pressed with a finger when done.
- **Potatoes, onions and similar vegetables** can be tested with a skewer. They can also be squeezed.
