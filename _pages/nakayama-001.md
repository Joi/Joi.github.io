[Purchased from Japan Stones](https://www.japanstones.com/product-page/892-nakayama-mizu-water-tomae-henckels-friodur-package)

> Nakayama mizu blue leading to green asagi kan pattern tomae hard razor stone, with tested tomonagura and a Henckels 5/8ths Friodur razor honed on the Nakayama. No guess work here in this package, every thing is tested and proven to HHT-5 standards. I will even include a shock of the test hair. A YouTube video using the kit can be available for an additional charge.
