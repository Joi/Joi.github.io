Spatchcocking is a way to prepare foul so that it is flatter and easier to cook.

You take shears and cut close to and on both sides of the spine and remove the spine. Then you open the bird along cut where the spine was and press it flat.

Optionally, you can also remove the wing tips and save it with the spine for making [[Chicken-Stock]].

The spatchcocked bird can be grilled or roasted.
