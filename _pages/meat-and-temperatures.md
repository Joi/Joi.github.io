As I've started dialing in and experimenting with cooking meats, I've settled roughly on the following pattern:

Roasting - sous vide in oven at a few degrees above the target temperature and hold it there for a period before searing it quickly at high temperature to finish.

Braising - low and slow after searing in a Dutch oven or Instant Pot slow cooker mode.

Smoking - low and slow in Weber grill with a quick sear or no sear at the end.

For tender meats, never go above 130ºF but be mindful to hold it at target temperature. Use 100% steam in Anova Precision Oven in Sous Vide mode with Probe.

For tougher meat, target 185ºF with appropriate hold.

I noticed that some meat got a funky smell when doing sous vide at low temperatures such as 130ºF. I found [a post](https://stefangourmet.com/2017/11/01/how-to-prevent-a-bad-smell-with-long-and-low-sous-vide-cooks/) that suggests that it is _lactobacillus_ which reproduces at temperatures between 55ºC / 131ºF and 59ºC / 138ºF. _Lactobacillus_ is not toxic, but smells - it is the bacteria in sourdough and cheese. The trick appears to be to pasturize with a quick sear or heating. This might be one reason to do the sear first and slow cook after.
