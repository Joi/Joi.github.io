As I've started dialing in and experimenting with cooking meats, I've settled roughly on the following pattern:

Roasting - sous vide in oven at a few degrees above the target temperature and hold it there for a period before searing it quickly at high temperature to finish.

Braising - low and slow after searing in a Dutch oven or Instant Pot slow cooker mode.

Smoking - low and slow in Weber grill with a quick sear or no sear at the end.

For tender meats, never go above 130ºF but be mindful to hold it at target temperature. Use 100% steam in Anova Precision Oven in Sous Vide mode with Probe.

For tougher meat, target 185ºF with appropriate hold.

Key temperatures:
