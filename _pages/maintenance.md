Maintenance and repair is one of the key activities in a kitchen and a home. One of the biggest things that Mizuka and I are trying to do with recipes and our home in general is to try to minimize are energy and trash footprint as well as focus on healthy things. This makes maintenance even more important.

If maintenance and cleaning become a chore, it can be overwhelming so I'm trying to make it both a hobby and a satisfying ritual.
