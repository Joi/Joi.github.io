Slurry is the water on a [[whetstones|whetstone]] mixed with the particles rubbed free from the base stone or off of the nagura or [[Mikawa Nagura]] - a small stoned rubbed on the base stone to create slurry. You can also run a whetstone with a diamond plate to get slurry of just the base stone - the diamond doesn't come off so it doesn't particles of its own.

The metal that comes off of the knife and turns the water dark as well as clogging up the surface of the whetstone is called "swarf." Unlike slurry, swarf isn't helpful and often slows down sharpening and honing.
