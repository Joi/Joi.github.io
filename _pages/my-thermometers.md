Notes:

I used to have a [Polder Safe Serve Instant Read Thermometer](https://polder.com/products/bbq-safe-serve-instant-read-thermometer), but I didn't like it because it was focused more on getting you to pick the kind of meat and then ringing an alarm when you got to that temperature rather than telling you the temperature. This meant lots of alarms going off when you didn't need them because I typically cook to a specific temperature rather than a default and don't need an alarm in an instant thermometer (for my remote thermometer, the alarms are useful).

I also owned a [Chugod Bluetooth BBQ Thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/Thermometer-Bluetooth-Grilling-Carrying-Included/dp/B075L7V6NZ/). I liked it but the range was too short and didn't reach most of my house. Also, whenever I went out of range, it would trigger and annoying alarm.

Refrigerators should be between 35ºF and 38ºF (1.7ºC - 33ºC) and freezers below 0ºF.
