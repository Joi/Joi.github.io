Mikawa Nagura are small stones used in sharpening and honing. They are rubbed on a [[whetstones|whetstone]], usually a Japanese natural finishing stone. They create a [[slurry]] which has a different particle size and type than the base stone and are used in progression to make each nagura successively fine and sharper hones. Mikawa Nagura are typically use for straight razors, but Japanese swords are also honed using Mikawa Nagura.

They are sometimes called Asano Nagura for the Asano quality control stamp.

The progression that I use and seems to be common is Botan, Tenjyo, Mejiro, Koma and then finally the Tomo Nagura which is a nagura made from the same stone as the base or something similar. Many people skip a few of the nagura in the progression since they're strictly not all required, but it's a kind of ritual.
