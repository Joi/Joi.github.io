  "notes": "In his recipe, Kenji Lopez-Alt says \"Note: This recipe calls for a large chicken. Do not try it with a smaller chicken, as it will dry out too much while cooking.\" However, he doesn't explain why. I think this is basically reverse sear so I'm not sure how it would become too dry. I tried to post a question on the site, but for some reason it didn't get posted. When I cooked a smaller (3.5 lbs) chicken, it came out juicy and great.",
