  "directions": "Pick up some bison sirloin steaks. Bison can be found more readily these days with the rise in popularity of bison farming. Check with farmers’ markets, co-ops, and high-end grocery stores. Or go online and see if you can find a bison ranch near you, or one that ships.\n\nSeason the bison sirloin steaks. With a good cut of meat like this, I recommend seasoning it simply with sea salt and black pepper. If you really wanted to, you could hit it with a little fresh garlic or lemon juice, but it really doesn’t need it\n\nGrill the bison sirloins over high heat. Heat up the grill to high for a few minutes beforehand, and clean the grates really well. Then wipe them with a little vegetable oil just before you grill the steaks. Grill them for a couple minutes, then rotate them 45 degrees to make the diamond grill marks.\n\nGrill the other side and let them rest. Flip the steaks over after five minutes on the first side. Let them grill for a couple more minutes, and then check the internal temperature with a digital thermometer. Rare 120‒125 degrees F, medium rare 130‒140, medium 140‒150, medium well 150‒160. Once done, let them rest uncovered for ten minutes. Serve with a little butter if you think you can handle it.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nBison sirloins, like beef sirloins, are a good quality and flavorful cut of meat. Don’t cover up that flavor with marinades and excessive seasoning.\n\nGrill the steaks over high heat to get the outside nice and crispy before the inside gets overcooked. That contrast of crispy and tender is highly prized in a steak.\n\nMake sure you let the steaks rest for ten minutes before you eat them.\n\nThe little knob of butter on top is there to make the steak sauce. When it melts and mixes with the meat juices, it makes a great sauce for dredging your bits of steak in.",
