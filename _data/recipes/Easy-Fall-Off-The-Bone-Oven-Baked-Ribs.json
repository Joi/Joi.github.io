  "directions": "PREPARE RIBS\n\nHeat oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135C).\n\nIf the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.\n\nSeason both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper then place, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half in order for them to fit into the pan).\n\nCover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 3 to 4 hours.\n\nMAKE BARBECUE SAUCE\n\nWhile the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\n\nAdd the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the cumin and cook for an additional 30 seconds.\n\nAdd the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2 minutes. Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.\n\nTO FINISH:\n\nRemove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.\n\nOptional: Move an oven rack near to the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they broil so they the sauce does not burn.)",
