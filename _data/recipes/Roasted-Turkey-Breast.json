  "description": "Perhaps your family is small. Perhaps your friends all bailed on you the week before Thanksgiving. Perhaps only half your family eats meat. Perhaps you simply don’t enjoy leftovers. (Weirdo.) Or perhaps you just had a craving for turkey in February and have no reason to cook a whole bird. Point is, there are any number of reasons you might have for not wanting to roast an entire turkey, but that doesn’t mean you should be deprived of juicy meat, crispy skin, and turkey-saturated stuffing, right?\n\nCooking a turkey breast is far easier than cooking a whole turkey, since you only have a single final target temperature in mind, instead of having to worry about the legs and breasts cooking at different rates. As soon as that breast is at 150°F, you can pull it out of the oven and let it rest.\n\nI’m the kind of guy who likes stuffing with my turkey, and this method makes it easy. Just plop the breast down on top of a pan of stuffing, throw it into a hot oven, and let it go. About halfway through cooking, the stuffing will threaten to burn. Do not panic—all you’ve got to do is remove the pan, transfer the turkey to a rack set on a rimmed baking sheet, and put it back in the oven on its own to finish roasting. Once the turkey is cooked, pour the pan juices over the stuffing and pop the stuffing back in the oven for one final crisp-up blast while the turkey rests.\n\nThe best part? The whole process goes from fridge to table in under two hours. This is the kind of stuff Sunday supper dreams are made of.\n\nNOTE: For the juiciest results and crispest skin, dry-brine the bird and air-dry it overnight as described here.",
