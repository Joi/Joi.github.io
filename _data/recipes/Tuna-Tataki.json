  "directions": "In a small bowl, mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, soy sauce, mirin and ginger. Set aside.\n\nIf your piece of tuna is wider, cut it into two similar-sized pieces, ideally both square/rectangular ended and even width.\n\nWarm the oil in a skillet big enough for the piece of tuna over a medium-high heat until it starts to smoke slightly.\n\nAdd the tuna to the pan and cook for no more than around 30-45 seconds each side to sear it. Remove from the pan and set aside a couple minutes.\n\nUsing a very sharp knife, cut the tuna thinly across the grain. Arrange the slices on a larger platter or two plates to serve. Drizzle over the sauce and decorate the plate, if you like eg with slices of lemon, green onions.",

  "notes": "If you want to add a little more of a kick, you can add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce. You can also add sliced jalepe√±os when you decorate. Typically a ponzu like this would also include dashi and/or dried bonito flakes for more umami flavor - feel free to add a small pinch.\n\nTo get a little more citrus flavor, you can rest the tuna on slices of lemon rather than just to decorate the plate.",
