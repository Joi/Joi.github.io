  "directions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Oil or butter one or two baking dishes large enough to accommodate the fish fillets in one layer. Lay the fish in the dish(es) and season with salt and pepper.\n\nHeat the olive oil over medium heat in a small or medium skillet and add the shallot. Cook, stirring, until tender and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the wine to the pan, bring to a boil, and pour the wine and shallots over the fish. Return the skillet to the stove (make sure the heat is off) for later use. Cover the baking dish with foil and place in the oven. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or 5 minutes for each 1/2 inch of thickness, until the fish is opaque and pulls apart easily with a fork.\n\nWhile the fish is in the oven:\n\nHeat a good-sized heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, adding the shallots, wine, vermouth, dashi-kombu, and stock to the pot all at once. Bring to a boil and adjust heat so it comes to a gently simmer. Cook down until the liquid is getting thick, almost syrupy.\n\nPull the pan from the heat and remove the dashi-kombu, discarding or saving for another use.\n\nReturn the pan to the heat and add the crème fraiche or heavy cream. If using the former, cook just longer enough until it is thickened to just coat the back of a spoon. If using cream, this will take a bit longer, but simmer until the cream will lightly coat the back of a spoon.\n\nScatter the sorrel over the sauce and wilt the sorrel for 25 seconds. Pull the pan from the heat and add the butter, swirling the pan to melt and incorporate the butter into an emulsion. If you think you need to stir the sauce, use a wooden spoon, not a whisk, which will catch the sorrel. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a few drops of lemon juice and taste. The lemon juice should add a spark to the sauce. Add more if you think it needs it.\n\nUse the sauce right away as it suffers if allowed to sit. If you need to, you can make the sauce up to the point where you remove the dashi-kombu. Then you can finish it quickly at the last minute.\n\nWhen the fish is done remove it from the oven and carefully transfer to a platter or plates and cover with sauce. Fish may complete before sauce. If so, plate on warm plates.",

  "name": "Sorrel Sauce with Poached Fish",
  "notes": "Chef’s Notes from High Ground Organics site: *The vermouth adds depth and some sweetness to the sauce. Cheap vermouth can be harsh or bitter, and the herbs and spices in them just are not very pleasant when reduced. I opted for Noilly Prat because it is a French product in a French dish, but any good quality white vermouth will work. **Dashi-kombu is a seaweed found in Japanese markets and health food stores. Kombu adds an oceanic quality missing if you do not have fish fumet. It also helps to add viscosity to the sauce. ***White pepper will blend into the sauce better, and has a slightly higher pitched flavor/aroma than black pepper, so it is called for here.",
