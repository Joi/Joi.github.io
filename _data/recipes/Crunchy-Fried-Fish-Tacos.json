Transfer fish pieces to bowl with batter and turn to coat thoroughly. Working one piece at a time, lift fish, let excess batter drip off, then transfer to bowl with remaining flour mixture. Toss to coat thoroughly. Lift carefully with tongs or dry fingers and slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat with remaining fish.\n\n4. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plated and season with salt.\n\n5. Divide tortillas into 8 double stacks. Top each with shredded cabbage, 1 piece of fish, pickled red onions, chili mayo, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.",
