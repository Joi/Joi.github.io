  "directions": "Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low to simmer.\n\nSimmer for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool completely before transferring to an air tight container.\n\nThis sauce can be used immediately, but I recommend refrigerating overnight for the best flavor. This sauce will last 2 weeks in the refrigerator if sealed tightly in an air tight container.",
