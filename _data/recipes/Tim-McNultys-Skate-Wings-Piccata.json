  "directions": "In a small bowl, combine the olive oil and the melted butter. Season the wings generously with salt and pepper and dredge two of them in the flour. Then dip them into the egg and coat them with bread crumbs. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and butter mixture in a large nonstick skillet and saute over medium heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes for each side. Transfer the wings to a warm platter and repeat with the remaining pieces, adding an additional tablespoon of the oil and butter mixture to the pan before cooking each batch.\n\nAdd the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil and butter mixture to the pan and saute the mushrooms over medium-low heat until soft and cooked through, about 7 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the lemon juice, capers and 3 tablespoons of water. Boil for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Season with salt and pepper and pour the mushrooms over the wings. Garnish with parsley and serve.",
