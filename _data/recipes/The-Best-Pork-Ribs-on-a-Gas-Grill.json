  "directions": "STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE BBQ PORK RIBS:\n\nRemove pork ribs from the packaging and pat ribs dry with a paper towel. Spray the aluminum pan with nonstick cooking spray or rub with oil. Place ribs into pan. Remove silver skin from the back side of the ribs. Cook’s note: This is optional. I like to remove it because it’s a tough and rubber-y membrane that can make it a bit more challenging to eat the ribs after they are cooked. It is super easy to remove since it will pull off in one piece. It also helps the pork rub penetrate the meat easier.\n\nSprinkle some of the pork rub seasoning onto the back of the ribs. It’s called ‘rub’ for a reason. So you want to really get in there and rub and press it in. Note: if you’d like, you can cut the rack of ribs in half to make it easier to handle on the grill later.\n\nFlip the ribs over and season the opposite side. The rule of thumb with rub seasoning is however much naturally sticks to the ribs is enough. Whatever falls off after rubbing it in can be discarded. Pour apple juice into the bottom of the pan. Cover pan with aluminum foil and place into the fridge until your grill is ready.\n\nWe are gonna be cooking these ribs at a low temperature for over an hour. So make sure your propane tank is full or that you have another tank on standby, just in case.\n\nPreheat grill to 300f degrees. It’s important to try to maintain this temperature through the cooking process so your ribs don’t cook too fast. I have 3 burners and I will usually keep the middle burner off and just keep the two end burners on low so it’s a nice, low, indirect heat for the ribs.\n\nClean the grill grates and carefully wipe them down with a bit of oil (you’ll need nice, clean, nonstick grates a little later.) Place pan of ribs onto grill. Cover grill and cook for about an hour (maintaining 300f degrees during the cooking process.)\n\nRibs are safe to eat when an inserted meat thermometer (into the thickest part of the meat – away from the bone) reaches 145f degrees. But by cooking it low and slow for a longer amount of time, the ribs will end up reaching a temperature closer to 180f -190f degrees and that creates a more tender meat. Carefully remove ribs from the pan and place directly on the grill. Ensure heat stays on low. Meanwhile, in a small pot over medium heat, whisk together marmalade and vinegar. Continue to whisk until it’s combined well. This should only take a minute or two. You can do this on the grill if you have a side burner attached to your grill.\n\nTake pot off heat and baste the cooked ribs with the marmalade sauce. Make sure to coat it well.\n\nCover grill and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Then repeat the process one more time.\n\nCarefully remove the ribs off the grill and place on a large cutting board and allow the meat to rest and cool for a few minutes.\n\nWith a sharp knife, carefully cut the ribs between the bones and serve!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRemove pork ribs from the packaging and pat ribs dry with a paper towel.
