Black pepper will work as well but flavor might vary some. \n\nI'm guessing at the measurements since I cooked mostly without measuring. 4cups(+/-) of water, 1/2cup(+/-)  of butter, 1/2tsp  of salt 1/2tsp of pepper. \n\nBring water to simmer, slowly add chunks of cold butter stirring to help with melting and mixing. Once butter is completely melted stir in salt and pepper. Butter water at a simmer, then add corn and let sit for 15-20mins or until you feel it is ready.\n",
