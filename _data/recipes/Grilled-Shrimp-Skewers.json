Toss to coat evenly with the marinade.\n\nMarinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. You don't want to marinate for longer than that, as the acid in the lemon juice will start to cook the shrimp.\n\nThread the shrimp onto skewers. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium high heat.\n\nPlace the skewers on the grill. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until shrimp are pink and opaque.\n\nBroiler directions: Preheat the broiler. Place the shrimp skewers on a sheet pan coated with cooking spray. Broil for 2-3 minutes on each side or until shrimp are pink and opaque.\n\nSprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.",
