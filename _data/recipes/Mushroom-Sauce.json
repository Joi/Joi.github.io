  "directions": "Heat oil and melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and leisurely cook until golden brown - takes about 4 to 5 minutes. No need to stir constantly.\n\nJust before they're done, add the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until garlic is golden (~ 1 minute).\n\nAdd white wine - it will sizzle! Stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet, for 1 minute or until mostly evaporated.\n\nAdd broth, cream and parmesan. Stir, then lower heat to medium so the sauce is simmering - do not boil rapidly, cream may split.\n\nStir occasionally and simmer for 2 - 3 minutes until it thickens. It shouldn't be super thick, this is a rich sauce.\n\nStir through thyme, adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove from stove.\n\nServe over steak or other cooked protein. Toss through pasta, stuff into baked potatoes, serve with roast beef, chicken or pork, smothered omelettes. See in post for more ideas!",
