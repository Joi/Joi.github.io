  "directions": "Preheat cast iron skillet on high for 3-4 minutes.\n\nCut through the fat along the backside of the steaks to prevent curling. Rub strip steaks with vegetable oil, and season with salt and tri-colored pepper.\n\nCook the first side of the steaks on high heat for 5 minutes, and then turn and cook for an additional 3 minutes, reducing heat to medium high.\n\nRemove from pan, and set aside on warm platter. Let steaks rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the juices to settle back into the meat.\n\nAdd butter, shallots, and peppercorns to cast iron skillet, and sauté until browned and caramelized. Stir often to prevent burning.\n\nAdd red wine all at once, and lower heat to medium. Cook until wine is reduced by ¾ of volume, about 15-20 minutes.\n\nServe red wine sauce over pan fried NY strips and enjoy!",
