  "directions": "1) Prep. Mix the garlic, rosemary, pepper, and water and let it sit for at least an hour so the water can extract the flavors. This is called a wet rub. Notice there is no salt. I like to salt it at the table with large grain salt that pops in my mouth.\n\n2) Trim off all the fat cap and as much of the fat near the bone as possible, This is called Frenching. There is often a tough silverskin membrane beneath the fat cap that needs to go, too. Yes, this is a lot of waste from a cut that was expensive to begin with. Work carefully so you don't waste any of this expensive meat. Cut the rack into four fat chops by slicing between every second bone. Try to make them the same thickness so the will cook at the same rate.\n\n3) Apply the wet rub. Use a lot. Much of it will fall off during cooking. You can let it marinate for a while, but it really won't penetrate much. One to three hours is enough.\n\n4) Fire up. Preheat the grill for 2-zone cooking with the direct heat side at Warp 10.\n\n5) Cook. Warm the meat gently on the indirect side with the lid down until it hits about 125°F. Then move the chops over the direct side to sear the exterior. Leave the lid open and place the bones over the edge away from the heat so they don't burn. This technique of warming the meat before grilling over direct heat is called reverse sear and it insures the most even colored interior possible. When you turn the meat try not to drag it across the grates and scrape off the rub, but turn often, about every 2 minutes. Take it up to 130°F or 135°F for medium rare (rosy color) or 140°F for medium (pink).\n\n6) Serve. Usually I want you to salt meat long before you cook (dry brining), but this small cut is best if you save a coarse salt for the end, just after serving, like granules on a pretzel. Go easy, it won't need much.\n\n2) Lamb Ribeye Steaks\n\nHere's an alternative way to prepare rack of lamb. Trim the fat, remove the rib bones, and season and grill the 12 to 14 ounce tube or ribeye meat like a steak. Grill the ribs along side the meat, slice the meat into medallions, and serve them with the bones on the side. Great fun!\n\nVideo: A Better Way to Prepare Lamb\n\nWe demonstrate a better way to prepare a rack of lamb.\n\n3) Whole Rack Of Lamb\n\nFinally, the traditional method, whole rack of lamb. Many recipes call for coating the meat with mustard and breadcrumbs. But they cover the meat and get all the browning action. I brown meat not brown bread, so I just flavor with Dolly's Lamb Rub Recipe, grill over high heat, and sprinkle with large grain seasoned salt at the table.",
