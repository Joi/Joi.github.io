  "directions": "OVEN METHOD:\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n\nWash and pat dry lamb shanks with paper towel.\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy based pot over medium-high heat. Sear two shanks in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Repeat with remaining shanks and oil.\n\nTransfer to a plate, tent with foil to keep warm, set aside.\n\nTo the pan juices, sauté the carrots and diced onions until softened, (about 3 minutes), then add garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n\nReturn the shanks back into the pot; season with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper. Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook for 4-5 minutes to brown the flour.\n\nAdd stock, wine, puree, tomato paste, bouillon and herbs. Bring to a simmer on the stove.\n\nCover, transfer to lower part of the oven and cook for 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is fall apart tender (adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly).\n\nGently transfer the shanks onto a plate; tent to keep warm.\n\nDiscard the bay leaves from the sauce and place pot onto stove. Simmer sauce over medium heat until thickened to your desired consistency.\n\nOPTIONAL: skim off any additional fat which rises to the surface.\n\nYou should be left with about 3 cups of sauce thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon.\n\n*If the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of stock. If the sauce is too thin, boil it over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until reduced to the right consistency. (See notes about thickening.)\n\nTaste for seasoning and adjust salt and pepper, if desired. Add the shanks back into the pot of sauce.\n\nGarnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or pasta.\n\nTo serve the following day, allow the casserole to cool completely, cover and refrigerate.\n\nThe day of serving, remove from refrigerator for at least an hour before reheating. Place over medium-low heat and let simmer gently for about 10 - 15 minutes, basting the shanks and vegetables with the sauce.\n\nINSTANT POT / PRESSURE COOKER:\n\nSet Instant Pot or Cooker to SEAR function (or use a pan on the stove over medium heat of you wish).\n\nWash and pat dry lamb shanks with paper towel.\n\nSear two shanks in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Repeat with remaining shanks and oil.\n\nAdd all shanks to the pot. Season with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper. Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook on SEAR for a further 4-5 minutes to brown.\n\nAdd in the onions, carrots, wine, stock, tomato puree, tomato paste, garlic, bullion and herbs. Stir well, cover and lock the lid into place. Press Keep Warm/Cancel to stop the Sauté function, then set to MANUAL mode. Choose HIGH PRESSURE for 30 minutes cook time.\n\nAfter cooking, allow the pressure to release naturally for 8-10 minutes. Open the valve and allow and remaining steam to escape (for Instant Pot, turn the valve from sealing to venting to release the pressure).\n\nChange the Instant Pot or cooker setting back to the SEAR setting (or SAUTE) stir well and allow the sauce to thicken uncovered, for a further 5-10 minutes.\n\nGarnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles.\n\nSLOW COOKER:\n\nWash and pat dry lamb shanks with paper towel.\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy based pot over medium-high heat.\n\nSear two shanks in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Repeat with remaining shanks and oil.\n\nTransfer to 6 quart (litre) slow cooker bowl.\n\nAdd in the onions, carrots and garlic. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper, tossing well to combine.\n\nPour the red wine into the pan or skillet and allow to simmer for 4-5 minutes, then whisk in the flour until free from lumps. Allow to reduce and thicken slightly, then pour it into the slow cooker along with the stock, tomato puree, tomato paste, bullion and herbs.\n\nMix well to combine all of the ingredients. Cook on high heat setting for 6 hours or low for 8 hours, or until lamb is fall apart tender.\n\nRemove shanks, transfer sauce to a pot and let simmer for 15 minutes over medium heat to reduce to desired thickness.\n\nGarnish with fresh parley and serve with mashed potatoes or rice.",
