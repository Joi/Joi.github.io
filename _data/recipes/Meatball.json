  "directions": "In a large mixing bowl stir together bread crumbs and milk while adding more milk 1 Tbsp at a time to moisten bread fully. Let rest while you prep ingredients (or at least 5 minutes).\n\nTo breadcrumb mixture add beef, pork, eggs, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, parmesan and season over top of ingredients evenly with salt and pepper (I only use 3/4 tsp salt if I plan on using jar sauce to coat since it can be salty).\n\nGently toss mixture and break meat up with fingertips until ingredients are evenly mixed.\n\nShape mixture with greased hands into even size meatballs, about 1 1/4-inches each (or about 38g).\n\nOven Baked Method\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees before you begin preparing meatballs.\n\nSpray two dark coated non-stick pans well with non-stick cooking spray (see note 4), or brush with olive oil.\n\nPlace formed meatballs on baking sheets, fitting about 20 per each and spacing evenly apart. Bake in upper and lower third of oven 10 minutes.\n\nRemove and turn meatballs if browned already on bottom (use a thin metal spatula to scrape from baking sheet). Transfer pans to opposite racks and bake until cooked through, about 8 - 12 minutes longer (should register 165 degrees in center of meatballs).\n\nStir into warmed marinara sauce. Simmer on low heat if desired for even more tender meatballs (about 10 - 20 minutes, toss occasionally gently).\n\nPan Fried Stovetop Method\n\nTo pan fry meatballs pour 3/4 cup olive oil into a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat over medium heat.\n\nCook meatballs in 3 batches (so they aren't overcrowded) until golden brown on bottom, about 4 - 6 minutes. Then turn to opposite side and cook opposite side until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain.\n\nTransfer meatballs to warmed marinara sauce (see note 5) in a large pot, submerge in sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat until meatballs are 165 degrees in center, gently tossing meatballs occasionally, about 15 - 20 minutes.",
