  "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nFor a lamb stew recipe with real flavor, finding the right cut of meat was half the battle. We found that slicing the meat off the bone from a lamb shoulder chop, browning it, and adding the bones and meat to the stewing liquid gave us a great lamb stew recipe with a rich-tasting broth and the velvety texture that only marrow-rich bones can contribute.",

  "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Cut meat from bones and reserve bones. Trim meat of excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Season meat generously with salt and pepper.\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in large ovenproof Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add half of meat to pot so that individual pieces are close together but not touching. Cook, without moving, until sides touching pot are well-browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, turn each piece and continue cooking until most sides are well-browned, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer meat to medium bowl, add another 1 tablespoon oil to pot, and swirl to coat pan bottom. Brown remaining lamb; transfer meat to bowl and set aside.\n\nReduce heat to medium, add remaining tablespoon oil, and swirl to coat pan bottom. Add onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently and vigorously, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits, until onions have browned, about 8 minutes. Add flour and stir until onions are evenly coated, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nStir in 1 1/2 cups of water, scraping pan bottom and edges with wooden spoon to loosen remaining browned bits. Gradually remaining 1 1/2 cups water, stirring constantly and scraping pan edges to dissolve flour. Add thyme and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to simmer. Add bones and then meat and accumulated juices. Return to simmer, cover, and place in oven. Cook for 1 hour.\n\nRemove pot from oven and place carrots and turnips on top of meat and bones. Cover and return pot to oven and cook until meat is tender, about 1 hour. If serving immediately, stir carrots and turnips into liquid, wait 5 minutes, and spoon off any fat that rises to top. (Stew can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Spoon off congealed fat and bring back to simmer over medium-low heat.)\n\nStir in parsley and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove bones if desired. Serve immediately.\n\nLike this recipe? Share it, or leave a comment below.",
