Working in batches, add the beef pieces to the pot in one layer so they’re not touching and sear on all sides until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and set aside on a plate. Repeat with all the beef.\n\nKeeping the pot over medium heat, add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the celery and mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Add the garlic powder, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce and cook for 1 minute more, stirring and scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a spoon. Add the beef broth and continue scraping up the brown bits for 1 minute. Return the beef and any of its juices to the pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 45 minutes.\n\nAdd the green beans and simmer for 10 minutes more with the lid slightly open. Stir in the radishes and simmer 5 minutes more.\n\nGradually sprinkle in the xanthan gum, mixing until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with the parsley and serve.",
