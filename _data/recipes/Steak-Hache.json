(Reserve the liquid if you want to add mushroomy savor to a future soup or pasta sauce. It freezes well as a few ice cubes.)\n\nIn a medium bowl, mix the beef, 6 tablespoons of the mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of the butter, 1 tablespoon of the onion, the egg, a large pinch of salt and the Parmesan until well combined. Form into 4 1-inch thick patties.\n\nMake porcini butter by combining the remaining mushrooms and 4 tablespoons of butter and a sprinkle of salt. Make salsa verde by soaking the remaining onion in the vinegar with a sprinkle of salt for 10 minutes, then adding the capers, parsley and olive oil to cover and make it a bit swimmy; taste for salt, and adjust.\n\nHeat a heavy cast-iron pan, and drizzle with olive oil. Cook the chopped steaks for 4 minutes on the first side, salting them liberally. Flip, and cook for 4 minutes on the second side, salting again. (Cook longer for medium.) Remove the steaks to a waiting hot plate. Top immediately with the porcini butter. Let rest a few moments, then spoon salsa verde over each, and serve.",
