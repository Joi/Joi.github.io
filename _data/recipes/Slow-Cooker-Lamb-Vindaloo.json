  "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nWe chose a hearty boneless lamb shoulder roast for this recipe, and it remained tender and juicy during the extended cooking time. A hefty amount of spices is key in this dish, but too much produced a chalky texture. To avoid this pitfall, we bloomed the spices with the aromatics, allowing us to use a more moderate amount. Some sugar and red wine vinegar also enhanced the flavors of the dish.",
  "difficulty": "",
  "directions": "Microwave onions, oil, paprika, garlic, tomato paste, cumin, cardamom, and cayenne in bowl, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes; transfer to slow cooker.\n\nStir tomatoes and their juice, broth, tapioca, vinegar, bay leaves, and sugar into slow cooker. Season lamb with salt and pepper and stir into slow cooker. Cover and cook until lamb is tender, 9 to 10 hours on low or 6 to 7 hours on high.\n\nDiscard bay leaves. Using large spoon, skim fat from surface of sauce. Adjust consistency with hot water as needed. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n",
