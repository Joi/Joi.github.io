  "directions": "Combine salt and sugar in small bowl. Sprinkle halibut evenly on all sides with salt mixture and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 45 minutes.\n\nFOR THE FISH: Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 120°F/49°C in 7-quart container. (If you prefer your fish to be fully opaque, set your sous vide bath to 135°F/57°C.)\n\nPat halibut dry with paper towels and brush with oil on all sides. Individually wrap each fillet with plastic wrap, and then arrange in single layer in 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until fillets are fully submerged, then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and seal bag fully. Cover and cook for at least 30 minutes or up to 45 minutes.\n\nFOR THE BROWNED BUTTER: Cut away peel and pith from lemon. Holding fruit over small bowl, use paring knife to slice between membranes to release segments. Cut segments crosswise into ½-inch pieces. Squeeze membranes over bowl to release juice; discard membranes and seeds.\n\nCook butter in small saucepan over medium heat, swirling constantly, until butter melts and turns dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in shallot and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off heat, stir in capers, parsley, and lemon segments and juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste; cover to keep warm.\n\nGently transfer halibut to cutting board and discard plastic. Pat fillets dry with paper towels and transfer to dinner plates. Spoon sauce over fillets and serve.",
