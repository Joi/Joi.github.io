  "directions": "**Brown Meat:** Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More. Wait until it says HOT (prevents meat from sticking to the pot). Add 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil in Instant Pot. Season one side generously with salt and black pepper. Add meat, then brown each side for 2 minutes. While one side is browning, season the other side with more salt and black pepper.\n\nAvoid overcrowding by browning meat in batches.\n\n**Saute Onion & Garlic:** Set aside the browned short ribs. Add in sliced onions, and saute until soften (~ 3 minutes). Add in chopped garlic, and saute until fragrant (~30 seconds).\n\n**Saute Veggies & Spices:** Add in chopped carrots, celery, thyme, and 2 bay leaves, then saute for 2 minutes.\n\n**Deglaze Instant Pot:** Pour ½ cup (125ml) red wine in Instant Pot and deglaze by scrubbing the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Give it a quick mix. Let the wine simmer for a minute to allow some of the alcohol to evaporate.\n\nAdd tomatoes, crush with spoon\n\n**Pressure Cook:** Add stock, sugar, meat and pressure cook for 45 min. (Maybe shorter.)\n\nMix kudzu with water, stir into stew.\n\nSeason with additional salt and serve. (I added 3 healthy pinches.)\n",
