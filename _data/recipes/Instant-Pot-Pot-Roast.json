  "directions": "Brown Chuck Roast: Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More function. Wait until it says HOT (~8 mins).\n\nPat dry the chuck roast steak with a paper towel, then generously season one side of the roast with kosher salt and ground black pepper. Drizzle the inner pot with 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil, and ensure to coat the oil over the whole bottom of the pot. Then, place the seasoned side of the roast in Instant Pot. Season the other side with more salt + black pepper.\n\nLet it brown for 10 minutes per side (don’t need to constantly flip the roast) to develop some awesome deep flavors. Set browned roast aside.\n\nSauté Onion & Garlic: Add in sliced onions and saute until softened. Add in a pinch of kosher salt and ground black pepper to season. Add in garlic and saute for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add in mushroom and saute for 2 mins. Then season with another pinch of kosher salt.\n\nDeglaze Instant Pot: Pour in a dash of red wine or balsamic vinegar, then deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.\n\nPressure Cook Pot Roast: Add 1 cup (250ml) of chicken stock, 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15 ml) fish sauce, 1 pinch of dried rosemary, 1 pinch of thyme, and 2 bay leaves in Instant Pot. Taste the seasoning and add more salt and pepper if desired.\n\nPlace the chuck roast and all its meat juice in Instant Pot.\n\nWith Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 45 minutes + Full Natural Release (25 minutes). Open the lid carefully.\n\nPressure Cook Vegetables: Set aside the chuck roast, and cover it with aluminum foil. Let it rest as you pressure cook the vegetables.\n\nSubmerge the quartered potatoes into the yummy gravy, then stack the chopped carrots on top of the potatoes. With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 4 minutes + Quick Release. Open the lid carefully.\n\nMake Gravy & Serve: Taste the gravy again, then adjust the seasoning if necessary. Mix 1 ½ tbsp (12g) cornstarch with 2 tbsp (30ml) water, then mix it into the gravy one third at a time until desired thickness.\n\nSlice the roast against the grain. High five your family. Serve pot roast and potatoes with the gravy. Immediately enjoy this umami filled dish you've just created!",
