Staged cooking of chicken parts inspired by [Cook's Illustrated's Braised Chicken with Basil and Tomato recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/11400-braised-chicken-with-basil-and-tomato).\n\nIt is easier to make the chicken tender if you do it in the oven because the heat will be slower and more even. So this starts on the stove and ends in the oven.\n\nThe key to the order of the chicken pieces going into the pot is to try to get them to finish around the same time.\n\nIt's important not to overcook the breasts. The dark meat is more forgiving.\n\nAlso, the skin slows down the temperature transmission when the skin is down and the pot is on the stove.",

Save the back and wing tips for stock.\n\nDry brine chicken with salt and pepper overnight.\n\nPreheat oven to 300 if using.\n\nBefore cooking, dredge chicken pieces in flour. I add a bit of extra salt and pepper, but not too much since it's dry brined.\n\nIn a Dutch oven, add a bit of olive oil and sear chicken. 4 min per side, 2 batches.\n\nAdd the butter and sauté the onions slowly until they are brown and tender - about 25 min.\n\nAdd wine and vinegar and turn up heat and deglaze if there are brown bits.\n\nLower heat and add ½ of the tarragon (or other chopped spice like Marjoram.)\n\nPut thighs and drumsticks in skin side up and bring to simmer. Cover and cook for 8 minutes. Add broad big pieces skin side down. Cover and cook until big breast pieces have an internal temperature of 105ºF to 115ºF degrees, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nTurn big breast pieces skin side up. Add smaller tapered breast pieces, skin side up. Transfer covered pot to oven or simmer and cook until breast pieces have an internal temperature of 150ºF and dark meat is 160ºF, 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nAfter chicken is done, remove and plate. Return pot to stove and add cream and simmer. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and vinegar. Add remaining tarragon and put sauce on chicken and serve.",
