  "directions": "If you want to serve this recipe with rice, I suggest getting the rice going prior to starting the curry.\n\nAdd the oil and onion to a soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion for 5 minutes.\n\nStir in the garlic and curry paste and cook for 30 seconds.\n\nAdd the chicken broth and fish sauce. Let it come to a boil and cook for a couple of minutes.\n\nReduce the heat and stir in the coconut milk.\n\nAdd the shrimp and red pepper. Let the soup simmer gently (don't let it reach a crazy boil) for 5 minutes or until the shrimp are cooked through.\n\nAdd lime juice to taste (I used 1/2 a lime) and salt & pepper as needed.\n\nAdd the cilantro, basil, and scallions prior to serving. Serve over rice (I love jasmine rice).",
