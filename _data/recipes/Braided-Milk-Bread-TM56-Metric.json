  "directions": "Lightly grease a large bowl and set aside. Place milk, butter, yeast and sugar into mixing bowl and warm 3 min/37°C/speed 2.\n\nAdd flour and salt and knead 3 min/. Place dough into prepared bowl, cover with cling wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (approx. 1 hr.).\n\nLine a baking sheet (approx. 40 cm x 35 cm) with baking paper and set aside. Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll each piece into a rope (approx. 45 cm). Join the 3 ropes at one end, braid together, and join again at the other end. Place braided dough onto prepared baking sheet, cover with cling wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rise again in a warm place until doubled in size (approx. 30 min.). Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.\n\nBrush braid with whisked egg and bake for 25-30 minutes (350°F/180°C) or until bread sounds hollow when tapped on the underside. Allow to cool on a wire rack before slicing.\n\nTips & tricks\n\nThe dough will be slightly sticky. If dough seems very wet after kneading, add 1 tbsp bread flour and knead a further Dough/3sec.\n\nIf living at high altitude let dough rise longer than recipe suggests. A mesh pop-up food cover can be placed over bread dough for the second rise. Lay hot, wet tea towels over top and sides of mesh food cover to stop dough from drying out while rising. Alternatively use the proof function on your oven.\n\nSprinkle with flaked almonds or turbinado sugar after brushing with egg.",
