  "directions": "Bring a pot of salty water to a boil and add the chicken breast to cook. Let the chicken simmer until is cooked through.\n\nMake sure you skim the foam that forms on top of the water as it starts boiling.\n\nWhile the chicken is cooking, place the tomatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with water, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and mushy but not falling apart.\n\nSlice the onions thinly. Heat the oil in a large pan(skillet) and add the onion. Cook the onion until soft and translucent for about 5-6 minutes.\n\nIn a blender, throw the tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper and 2-3 chipotle chiles from the can. Be careful with the chiles. The original Mexican recipe calls for the entire can of Chipotle, but I found it to be too powerful and spicy for us, so I added fewer chiles in the blender.\n\nAfter blending the ingredients, taste the salsa for salt and pepper and adjust the amount of salt and pepper.\n\nPour the salsa over onions. Add oregano, marjoram, thyme and pepper.(Be careful as the sauce will steam and bubble).\n\nSimmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until the sauce deepens in color, becomes darker and less soupy, about 7-8 minutes.\n\nTake the chicken out of the broth and with two forks, shred the meat.\n\nAdd it to the sauce and mix well to incorporate the chicken.\n\nLet it simmer for only a minute and serve over rice or on warm tortillas.\n\nBon Appetite!",
