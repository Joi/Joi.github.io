Season with salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.\n\nCook until the flavors have come together and the vegetables and greens are tender, about 20 minutes more. If you added raw chicken, remove it from the soup when cooked, allow to cool, shred and return to the soup. Taste and adjust for salt.\n\nAdd more hot liquid if needed to thin the soup to desired consistency. Taste and adjust for salt.\n\nServe hot, and garnish as desired.",
