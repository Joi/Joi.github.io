  "directions": "1. Crush Garlic\n\nPlace the garlic in a blender and give it a quick pulse to lightly crush it or crush the garlic in a mortar. It should be very chunky.\n\n2. Season Chicken\n\nPlace chicken in a bowl. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix well to ensure the seasoning gets all over the chicken.\n\n3. Add Buttermilk and Garlic\n\nAdd the buttermilk and crushed garlic to the bowl with the chicken. Mix lightly so the buttermilk and garlic are well distributed.\n\n4. Let Chicken Marinate\n\nCover the bowl of chicken with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.\n\n7. Coat Chicken with Breading\n\nLift a piece of chicken from the buttermilk and shake so the excess buttermilk drips off. Place the chicken in the bowl with the breading. Press the breading onto the chicken and completely coat the chicken with the breading.\n\n8. Transfer Chicken to Rack\n\nNote: For this stage it is best to use a baking sheet with an oven-safe rack that fits into the sheet. Or you could just place the chicken on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and sprayed with oil. Cover baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up. Fit an oven-safe rack over the baking sheet. Brush oil over the rack or spray the rack with oil. Place breaded chicken pieces on the rack.\n\n9. Cook Chicken\n\nInsert probe into the thickest part of the chicken and cook until the probe reads 160 degrees Fahrenheit. It takes about 17 minutes.\n\n10. Brush Chicken With Butter\n\nRemove chicken from oven then brush 2 tablespoons of melted butter all over the chicken making sure to brush the areas where the flour is still white.\n\n11. Crisp Chicken\n\nAlllow oven to preheat then place chicken back into oven and let it cook until golden brown on top. It takes about 10 minutes.\n\n12. Serve\n\nServe the oven fried chicken with coleslaw and biscuits or mac and cheese.",
