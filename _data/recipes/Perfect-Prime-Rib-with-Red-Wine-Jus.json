  "directions": "Add Stock\n\nIn goes a full quart of chicken stock. If you have good homemade stock, that's the best option. If not, a high-quality store-bought low-sodium stock will do. I use Swanson or Kirkland organic if I need to go with store-bought. Dissolving a couple of packets of gelatin on the surface of the stock before adding it to the pot will improve the finished texture of the sauce if you're using store-bought.\n\nSeason Prime Rib\n\nGenerously season a bone-in standing rib roast (a.k.a. prime rib) with plenty of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. You want to get it on all sides.\n\nPrepare the Roasting Pan\n\nPlace the seared bones/oxtails/shins in the bottom of a roasting pan. (There's no need for an expensive one—I explain why you don't need an expensive roasting pan here.) Then pour all of the liquid on top of them, along with the vegetables. Set a V-rack directly on top of the vegetables and liquid.\n\nPlace Beef in Pan\n\nPlace the beef in the roasting pan with the bone facing down and the fat cap facing up.\n\nRoast\n\nPlace the pan in an oven set to 250°F. Slow roasting at a very low temperature is the key to meat that is perfectly evenly cooked from edge to edge, with a very tender interior texture.\n\nRest the Meat and Finish the Jus\n\nTent the roast lightly with aluminum foil (it may still appear quite pale on the exterior at this point—that's okay), then transfer the oxtails and/or shins to a medium saucepan.\n\nStrain the Liquid and Finish the Jus\n\nStrain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into the saucepan. Simmer the shins/oxtails in the jus on the stovetop until the meat is tender enough to easily shred off the bones. This should take about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the meat and bones from the pot (that shredded meat makes for a great appetizer or side dish when spread onto toast), season the jus to taste with salt and pepper, and whisk in 4 tablespoons of butter off-heat.\n\nBrown the Beef\n\nWhen you're about 10 minutes away from serving, return the beef to the cleaned-out roasting pan and blast it in an oven set at the highest possible temperature (that's 500 to 550°F for most home ovens—use convection if you've got it) until the exterior is browned and crisp. This should take between 6 and 10 minutes. Once browned, the beef is ready to carve and serve.\n\nRemove Bones\n\nTo carve the beef, start by removing the bones with a sharp knife, lifting the beef with one hand and following the contours of the bones with your knife.\n\nReady to Slice\n\nWith the bones removed, the beef should be ready to slice.\n\nSlice and Serve\n\nSlice the beef thinly and serve it with the jus. I like to sprinkle each slice with a little coarse sea salt to ensure that it's seasoned throughout.",
