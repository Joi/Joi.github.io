  "description": "Traditional home cooking from the Philippines. Easy to make and very tasty - a kind of umami bomb of amino acid flavors. \n\nYou can make this without the pork or the shrimp. You can also add tofu. I would suggest harder tofu, chopping the tofu into squares or rectangles and frying before adding to stir fry.\n\nI typically make it with twice as much meat and shrimp.",
  "difficulty": "",
  "directions": "Works well in a wok but you can use any sauté pan.\n\n[photo:2]\n\nChop the onion, garlic and tomato and put in a bowl or vat. Chop the bok choy and shrimp and put in another bowl or vat.\n\nHeat pan slowly if you have time so that the whole pan gets hot and can hold the heat through the stir fry.\n\nAdd oil to pan and add onion, garlic and tomato and sauté.\n\nAdd ground beef and sauté until brown.\n\nAdd shrimp and bok choy and stir-fry for 3 - 5 min until the bok choy is tender, but not soft. If you want, you can separate the leafy part from the thick stems and add them a min or two after the thick parts.\n\nAdd fish sauce and ground black pepper.",
