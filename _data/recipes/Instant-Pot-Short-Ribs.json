  "directions": "Brown Short Ribs in Instant Pot: Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More. Wait until it says HOT (prevents short ribs from sticking to the pot). Add 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil in Instant Pot. Season one side generously with salt and black pepper. Add in 5 pieces of short ribs, then brown each side for 4 minutes. While one side is browning, season the other side with more salt and black pepper.\n\n*Pro Tip: Avoid overcrowding by browning short ribs in batches.\n\nSaute Onion & Garlic: Set aside the browned short ribs. Add in sliced onions, and saute until soften (~ 3 minutes). Add in chopped garlic, and saute until fragrant (~30 seconds).\n\nSaute Veggies & Spices: Add in chopped carrots, celery, a pinch of dried thyme, and 2 bay leaves, then saute for 2 minutes.\n\nDeglaze Instant Pot: Pour ½ cup (125ml) red wine in Instant Pot and deglaze by scrubbing the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Give it a quick mix. Let the wine simmer for a minute to allow some of the alcohol to evaporate.\n\nPressure Cook Short Ribs: Add 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15ml) fish sauce, 1-1.5 tbsp (14-21g) brown sugar, 2 tbsp (30ml) balsamic vinegar, and ½ cup (125ml) unsalted chicken stock in Instant Pot. Carefully add in browned short ribs + meat juice.\n\nIf you are making mashed potatoes: Cut 3 - 4 potatoes in half, then place them in a stainless steel bowl. Layer the bowl on top of the short ribs.\n\nThen, pressure cook:\n\nWith Potatoes: High Pressure 42 minutes + Natural Release 15 minutes\n\nNo Potatoes: High Pressure 45 minutes + Natural Release 15 minutes\n\nOptional - Make Mashed Potatoes: Drain & transfer the potatoes to a larger mixing bowl. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Mix in 100ml whole milk and 1 – 2 tbsp (14g -28g) unsalted butter. Season to taste with salt & pepper.\n\nThicken & Seasonings: Carefully set aside the short ribs. Mix 2.5 tbsp (22.5g) cornstarch and 3 tbsp (45ml) cold water together in a small mixing bowl. Bring the sauce to a simmer and add the cornstarch mixture one third at a time to thicken the red wine sauce until desired thickness. Taste and season with more salt, black pepper, and brown sugar if necessary (For reference: we added 3 large pinches of salt).\n\nServe Short Ribs: Carefully place the short ribs back in the sauce to keep them hot. Serve & be prepared for your guests to beg for more of this deliciously beautiful creation!",
