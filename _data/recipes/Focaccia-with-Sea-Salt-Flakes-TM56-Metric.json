  "directions": "Dough\n\nLine a baking tray (40 cm x 35 cm) with baking paper and set aside.\n\nPlace water, flour, yeast, olive oil, sugar and salt into mixing bowl and heat 1 min 30 sec/37°C/speed 1, then knead 3 min/. With aid of oiled spatula, transfer dough onto prepared baking tray. With wet or oiled hands, flatten and spread dough to edges of baking tray. Set aside and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes.
