Pat the livers dry on paper towels.\n\nHeat the oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add onions and saute slowly, over low heat, until golden and tender, about 20 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper.\n\nSprinkle with sage and wine and the raisins and vinegar. Reduce heat to low, return onions to pan, mix them in to reheat. Serve liver and onions moistened with the pan juices.",
