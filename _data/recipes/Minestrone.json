  "description": "Minestrone is a mellow vegetable soup, and its composition depends on the best vegetables available. This minestrone is all vegetables-healthful and inexpensive. For a true vegetarian soup, use water instead of chicken stock. While many versions of minestrone are thick, this one is light and thin. The composite taste is a blend of all the elements, but each vegetable also keeps its separate identity.",

  "directions": "\rHeat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the butter in it, add the onion, and saute over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until it is well browned-10 to 15 minutes. Add the remaining vegetables, the bay leaf, and a little salt and pepper. Continue to cook, stirring the vegetables frequently with a wooden spoon, for 15 minutes. Add the water or stock and the tomato sauce. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and thin the soup with a little boiling water if it is too thick. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter, taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning. Serve very hot and pass a bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.",
