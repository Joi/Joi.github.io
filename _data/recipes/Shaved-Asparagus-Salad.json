  "directions": "Make the shavings: Lay asparagus spears on a flat surface. With a vegetable peeler, shave each spear from the tip to the base (discard the outer peel). It takes a little practice, but it’s easy once you get the hang of it! Place the shavings in a bowl, and pat them dry to remove extra water. (You’ll have a lot of discarded pieces: you can save these and use them in a stir fry.)\n\nMake the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, add the lemon juice. Then gradually whisk in the olive oil, 1 tablespoon at a time.\n\nServe: Toss the vinaigrette with the asparagus shavings, Parmesan shavings, kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. Top with lemon zest (here’s how to zest it!) and a few pinches of red pepper flakes. Taste, and add additional seasonings if desired.",
