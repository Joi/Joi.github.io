  "directions": "In the bowl of a food processor, make a paste with the garlic, pepper, thyme, and a pinch of salt. Place the meat in a shallow vessel. Rub the paste over the meat. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and Worcestershire. Pour this mixture over the meat. Turn the meat to coat in the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, prepare a grill for high heat. (See notes above). Wipe off excess marinade. Season meat on both sides generously with salt and pepper. Grill over hot coals uncovered, 2 to 3 minutes a side until a thermometer registers 125ºF for medium rare or 135ºF for medium. Transfer meat to a board to rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Reference the video above if you are having a hard time figuring out which way is against the grain — it’s not always easy to tell.",
