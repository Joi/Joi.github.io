Continue to heat, swirling the pan periodically, until it begins to brown.\n\nReduce the heat to medium-low. Dredge both sides of the salmon fillets in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess then gently place them in the hot butter, top-side down. Cook without disturbing them for 3 minutes, until the top is golden brown. When the salmon turns opaque on the sides and starts to turn opaque on top, use a flexible spatula to flip the salmon.\n\nAdd the lemon zest and lemon juice to the pan. Place the skillet immediately into the oven and let cook for 6 minutes (the salmon will appear a little undercooked in the center but will finish cooking as it rests). Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Let rest 4 to 5 minutes.\n\nTo serve, place each piece of salmon on a plate and spoon the pan sauce liberally over the top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and capers. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy immediately.",
