  "directions": "Grab a large, shallow plate (like a pie dish) and combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Pat your fillets dry and sprinkle additional salt over the top.\n\nMelt your butter in a large oven-safe skillet. Swirl the pan a few times until the butter starts to brown. This will create irresistible flavor!\n\nReduce the heat to medium-low, and dredge both sides of the fillets in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.\n\nGently lay your fillets in the melted butter, top-side down. Cook undisturbed until golden brown. Once the salmon turns opaque on the sides and begins to turn opaque on top, flip it over.\n\nAdd your lemon zest and lemon juice to the skillet, and place it into the oven. After 6 minutes, remove the skillet from the oven, cover it with foil, and let it rest. (Your salmon will continue to cook while it rests.)\n\nWhen ready to serve, place each fillet on a plate, and spoon the sauce from the pan over the top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and capers, then enjoy immediately. Don’t forget to take a moment to revel in your delicious culinary triumph!\n\nWhile finishing the fish in the oven isn’t a typical step in meuniere-style fish recipes, I found that searing the salmon on the stove and finishing it in the oven was the perfect combination. Since salmon is thicker than the delicate varieties (like sole) that are typically used, the oven helps give great texture and ensures that it’s perfectly cooked.\n\nWhat to Serve with Salmon Meuniere\n\nRoasted Vegetables. Fresh and delicious roasted asparagus, broccoli, or Roasted Brussels Sprouts would complement this dish nicely.\n\nRice. A bed of Lemon Rice will soak up all the yummy sauce from the pan.\n\nSautéed Vegetables. Simple vegetable sides like Sautéed Cabbage and Sautéed Zucchini would allow the salmon flavors to shine.\n\nHow to Store and Reheat Salmon Meuniere\n\nTo Store. Let your cooked salmon meuniere cool, and then place it in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n\nTo Reheat. You can reheat this dish on the stove or in the microwave (I prefer the stove method). After reheating, I like to add a little lemon juice to freshen up the leftovers.\n\nFor the stove, heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil in the pan so that the salmon does not dry out or stick to the pan. After about a minute, add your salmon piece to the skillet and let it heat for about 5 minutes per side until warm.\n\nFor the microwave, place your salmon meuniere on a microwave-safe plate, cover it with a paper towel, and microwave for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, I suggest checking your salmon, adjusting it for even heating, and continuing to microwave if necessary.\n\nTo Freeze. In my opinion, salmon tastes best the day it is made, but you can freeze leftovers if needed. To freeze your salmon meuniere, place it in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 2 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.\n\nI enjoy using thawed salmon in scrambled eggs or tossed with pasta dishes.\n\nPlace a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.\n\nIn a large, shallow plate (a pie dish works well), combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels and sprinkle the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt over the top.\n\nMelt the butter in a large (12-inch) oven safe cast iron skillet or similar sturdy-bottomed oven safe skillet over medium heat. Continue to heat, swirling the pan periodically, until it begins to brown.\n\nReduce the heat to medium-low. Dredge both sides of the salmon fillets in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess then gently place them in the hot butter, top-side down. Cook without disturbing them for 3 minutes, until the top is golden brown. When the salmon turns opaque on the sides and starts to turn opaque on top, use a flexible spatula to flip the salmon.\n\nAdd the lemon zest and lemon juice to the pan. Place the skillet immediately into the oven and let cook for 6 minutes (the salmon will appear a little undercooked in the center but will finish cooking as it rests). Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Let rest 4 to 5 minutes.\n\nTo serve, place each piece of salmon on a plate and spoon the pan sauce liberally over the top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and capers. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy immediately.",
