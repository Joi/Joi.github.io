(You don't have to use all of seasoning mix)\n\nMassage the spices into the ribs, adding more olive oil to help distribute the spices well if needed.\n\nPlace the ribs in a large ziplock bag or covered bowl and marinate in the fridge for 1-2 hours.\n\nPreheat the oven to 250 F.\n\nPlace the ribs on a foil lined baking tray in a single layer.\n\nAdd another piece of foil on top to create a pouch for the ribs to cook in. Be sure to seal the edges of the foil so that it's tight and steam won't seep out.\n\nBake on the middle rack of 3 1/2 -4 hours. (Mine only needed 3 1/2 hours) Check on it after the 3 1/2 hour mark. The oven temperature is very low so you can afford to cook it a bit longer without worry)\n\nWhen the ribs are done to your liking, drain off the excess fat.\n\nBrush the ribs with desired amount of BBQ sauce.\n\nBroil on low until the sauce is sticky. (this won't take long so keep an eye on it)\n\nServe hot and enjoy!!",
