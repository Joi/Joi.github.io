  "directions": "1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don’t over handle the meat.\n\n2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\n\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\n\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\n\n3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500°F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\n\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\n\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:\n\nFor rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125°F)\n\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135°F)\n\nFor medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145°F)\n\nFor well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160°F)\n\nFlip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.\n\n5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.\n\n6 Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.\n\n7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, sautéed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.",
