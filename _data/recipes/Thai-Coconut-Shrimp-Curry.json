  "directions": "Prep shrimp as needed. Should be peeled, cleaned, and thawed if frozen. I used extra-large shrimp but medium and large work great too.\n\nDice onion, cut bell pepper into thin strips and chop, and mince or slice your jalapeno. For a spicier curry, include the jalapeño seeds and use two jalapeños. For a more mild curry remove the seeds and only use one jalapeno or skip entirely.\n\nHeat the oil over medium-high heat in a large pan. Add onion, jalapeno, and bell pepper and cook until softened, approx 4-5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer veggies to a bowl and set aside.\n\nOver medium heat, add the coconut milk, red curry paste, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Whisk together and bring to a gentle boil. In a small bowl, add 1.5 TBSP cornstarch to 1.5 TBSP cold water and whisk to dissolve. Add to sauce and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally. Approx 5 minutes.\n\nPat shrimp dry and add to the sauce along with your cooked veggies. For more al dente vegetables, you can add them at the end if you prefer. Allow curry to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through and opaque.\n\nAt this point you can taste-test the curry and decide if you'd like more heat (cayenne or red pepper flakes may be added to amp up the spiciness) or extra of any of the ingredients. Sometimes I'll stir in extra red curry paste or add a teeny pinch of salt, to taste.\n\nTop with Thai basil. Serve with jasmine rice or basmati rice or see blog post for more tasty serving suggestions!",
