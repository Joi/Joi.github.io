  "directions": "Thinly slice garlic, then mash into a paste using the side of a chef’s knife. Scatter rosemary leaves over garlic; finely chop and mix into garlic. Slice tenderloin in half crosswise to create 2 smaller roasts. Season generously with salt and pepper; rub with garlic-rosemary paste. If your butcher didn’t already tie the roast for you, this is the time to do it: Place tenderloin onto lengths of precut kitchen twine spaced about 1\" apart and tie closed snugly. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and chill uncovered 12 hours.\n\nLet tenderloin sit at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours before cooking.\n\nPreheat oven to 250°. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add tenderloin and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned all over, 8–10 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and roast tenderloin, turning every 10 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120°, 25–30 minutes. Transfer tenderloin to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before removing kitchen twine and slicing. Reserve skillet.\n\nMeanwhile, mix yogurt, sour cream, horseradish, and lemon zest in a small bowl to combine; season with salt and pepper.\n\nCook butter and rosemary sprigs in reserved skillet over medium heat, scraping up browned bi ts on the bottom, until butter is melted and very fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer sliced tenderloin to a platter; drizzle with rosemary-infused butter and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with horseradish yogurt.\n\nDo Ahead: Tenderloin can be seasoned and chilled 2 days ahead; wrap in plastic wrap after 12 hours. Horseradish yogurt can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.",
