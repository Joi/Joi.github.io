  "notes": "I put the red onion in the jar with the dressing to allow it to “marinate” a bit and it cuts the bite of it a little. This doesn’t have to be done but it gives it a nice flavor.\n\nI have used apple cider vinegar here too and although it gives it a slightly different taste, it works well.",
