  "description": "This is probably my favorite beef marinade of all time. Sweet, spicy, sour, and salty, it encompasses the four basic flavors of Thai cuisine. While there’s no salt added to the recipe, the fish sauce and soy sauce are plenty salty.\n\nNOTES: You can also cook the meat indoors in a grill pan or in a large skillet—split the steak crosswise in half so you can fit it in the pan. Flank steak can be replaced with hanger, skirt, or flap meat.",

  "directions": "1. To make the marinade: Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer to a small bowl. Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and chile powder and stir to combine. Transfer half the marinade to a small container and reserve. Add the oil to the remaining marinade and whisk to combine. Place the flank steak in a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag, add the marinade, press out the air, and seal the bag. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for at least 1 hour, and up to 12 hours.\n\n2. Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Ignite a large chimneyful of coals and wait until they’re covered in gray ash, then spread evenly over one half of the grill grate. Put the cooking grate in place, cover, and allow the grill to preheat for 5 minutes. Or, if using a gas grill, heat one set of burners to high and leave the rest off. Scrape the cooking grates clean.\n\n3. Place the flank steak on the hot side of the grill and cook until well charred on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip the steak and continue to cook until the second side is well charred, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer the steak to the cooler side of the grill, cover, and cook until the center of the steak registers 125°F for medium-rare, or 135°F for medium, on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil, and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes. \n\r4. Thinly slice the beef against the grain and transfer to a large bowl. Add the herbs, shallots, cucumber, bean sprouts, and reserved marinade and toss to combine. Serve immediately.",
