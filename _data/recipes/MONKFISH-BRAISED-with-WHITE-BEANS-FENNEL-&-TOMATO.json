  "description": "THIS DISH REAPPEARS IN A NUMBER OF FORMS AT ZUNI, SOMETIMES WITH THICKLY sliced boiled potatoes instead of beans, or with house-salted cod in lieu of monkfish, or with big chunks of blanched leeks in place of the fennel. In summer, we shove a bouquet of basil stems into the tomato sauce, or stir whole leaves into the simmering sauce just before baking it. In any variation, the recipe is forgiving with regard to exact amounts, so long as each of the elements is delicious to begin with. And succulent, meaty monkfish is fairly forgiving with regard to cooking time.\n\nIf you plan to make the fumet, ask for monkfish bones when you buy the fillets. {The fumet will take less than an hour to make.} You can cook the beans a day or two in advance.",
  "difficulty": "",
  "directions": "**Seasoning the fish** {for the best flavor, do this 4 to 12 hours in advance}: Briefly rinse and then dry the monkfish fillets. Salt them lightly and evenly. Cover loosely and refrigerate.\n\nWarm about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the fennel and cook until slightly golden, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce the heat, add the onions, another tablespoon or two of oil, and a few pinches of salt, and cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring and turning the pieces of fennel as needed. The salt, low flame, and stirring should coax the onions to “sweat” their water without browning.\n\nAdd the white wine and raise the heat to boil it briefly, then add the tomatoes, garlic, chili, saffron, and the pastis or ouzo, if using. Bring to a quiet simmer and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the fumet or chicken stock {or a combination of fumet or stock and reserved bean liquid} and another tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the beans and simmer briefly, then correct for salt and set aside.\n\n**Cooking the fish:**\n\nPreheat the broiler. Position the rack so it is about 6 inches from the element. Pat the fish fillets dry. Warm about 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch skillet, nonstick if you have one, over medium heat. Arrange the pieces of monkfish in the oil; they should sizzle on contact. Don’t crowd the fish, or it will steam, but make sure that you don’t have too much empty pan space either~the oil will rapidly overheat in these spots. As long as the oil is hot enough and the fish is dry on the surface, it should not stick, even in a non-nonstick pan, but in any case, don’t fuss with it. Let the fish develop a pale golden crust before you try to turn it; this should take about 3 minutes. Then cook until golden on the second side.\n\nWhen you finish searing the monkfish, nestle it in the pan of sauce. Set over medium-low heat and swirl as you bring to a simmer. Cook gently for about 6 minutes, until medium-rare.\n\nTransfer to the broiler to finish cooking and brown the tips of the fish, fennel, and tomatoes, about 5 minutes. Look for the juices to begin caramelizing around the rim, but reduce the oven temperature if it looks as if the dish might burn. I sometimes assemble, finish, and serve the dish in a 2-inch deep, 4-quart ceramic baking dish or similar-sized copper roasting pan. I like to bring the whole dish, still bubbling, to the table. Offer the Aïoli on the side.",
