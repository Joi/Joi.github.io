  "description": "Stock With stock on hand, dinner is always within reach. A tasty, simple, quick dinner that can take one of countless forms—soup, yes of course, but also stuffing and panade , a gratin made with bread and abundant stock. Or grains cooked in stock, which deliver flavor and protein without relying on meat. Or a poached egg and just-wilted spinach drowned in stock. And then, of course, there are the endless braises, soups, and stews that stock will enrich.\n\nEvery time you roast a chicken, cut off the neck or head, feet, and wingtips (and even the backbone, when spatchcocking ) before salting, and throw them all into the freezer in a plastic bag. Then, after dinner, add the carcass into the plastic bag. One chicken carcass isn’t really enough to warrant a pot of stock, so save up three or four and make stock every month or two. You can also save onion ends, the last stalk of celery that’s about to go rubbery, parsley stems, and carrot ends and store these in a bag in the freezer. When your freezer can no longer contain the mess, empty it all out into a big pot and prepare to make stock.\n\nIf all you have on hand is roasted bones, it’s worth making a trek out to the butcher shop to buy a few pounds of chicken heads and feet, or some wingtips. The gelatin the raw bones contain will add a ton of body and richness to the stock.",

  "directions": "Put everything but the vinegar in a large stockpot. Bring the stock to a boil over high heat, then turn down to a simmer. Skim any foam that rises to the surface. Now add the vinegar, which will help draw out nutrients and minerals from the bones into the stock.\n\nSimmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours. Keep an eye on it to make sure it stays at a simmer. If stock boils, its bubbles will recirculate fat that rises to the top of the stock. With the sustained heat and agitation, the stock will emulsify. This is one of the times you’re not looking for an emulsion, because beyond looking cloudy, emulsified stock also tastes cloudy and clings to the tongue in an unpleasant way. One of the best things about good stock is that though its flavor is rich, it’s also clean.\n\nStrain through a fine-meshed sieve and cool. Scrape the fat that rises to the top and save it in the fridge or freezer for Chicken Confit.\n\nRefrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. I like to freeze stock in old yogurt containers, which have the added benefit of premeasurement.\n\nVariations\n\n• To make Beef Stock, follow the same process, but replace the chicken with 6 pounds meaty beef bones (such as knuckle bones) and 1 pound beef marrow bones. Brown the bones on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer in a 400°F oven for about 45 minutes. Brown the aromatics in the recipe above in the stockpot with a few tablespoons of olive oil before adding the bones, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, and water. Set the baking sheet over a burner set to low heat, and pour in 1 cup dry red wine. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to loosen all of the caramelized bits from the pan, and add them, along with the wine, into the stockpot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for at least 5 hours before straining. To make a Super-Rich Beef Stock , begin with chicken stock instead of water.",
