  "directions": "1. Press the fillets between paper towels to dry all surfaces thoroughly. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. And the fish fillets skin side down, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, pressing gently on the back of the fillets with a flexible metal fish spatula to ensure good contact between skin and pan for the first minute. Then continue cooking until the skin has rendered its fat and is crisp, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift the fish with a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.\n\r2. Flip the fish and cook on the second side until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120째F for medium-rare, or 130째F for medium, about 1 minute longer. Transfer the fish to a paper-towel-lined plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
