  "directions": "Spread flour in a shallow bowl or plate. Tie the thyme sprigs, rosemary sprigs, and bay leaf together with kitchen twine.\n\nSeason the veal with the salt and pepper to taste, and then dredge it in the flour to coat all sides. Using the sauté function on high if available, heat the oil in the pressure cooker. Add the osso buco in batches (do not crowd the pot), and brown it well on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Altogether this will take 20 to 30 minutes to get the pieces nicely golden all over. Transfer the osso buco pieces to a plate as they brown.\n\nTurn the sauté function down to medium if available, or unplug the pot for a minute to let it cool down slightly. Add the butter to the pressure cooker and let it melt; then stir in the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and tomato paste, and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the tomato paste has darkened, another 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAdd the wine to the pot to deglaze it, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Stir in the stock and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Nestle the osso buco pieces into the pot, then top with the herb bundle. Cover and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.\n\nTransfer the osso buco to a plate and, using the sauté function, simmer the sauce, stirring it often, until it is thick and reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the sauce settle for at least 10 minutes, and then spoon any excess fat off the top.\n\nWhile the sauce is settling, make the gremolata: In a small bowl, stir together the parsley, lemon zest, garlic, and salt.\n\nTo serve, transfer the osso buco to a serving platter, spoon the sauce over the top, and sprinkle with the gremolata, with more on the side.",
