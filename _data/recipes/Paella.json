  "description": "Based on [this Simply Recipes recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/seafood_paella_on_the_grill/).\n\nOriginal recipe calls for doing this on a grill, but can easily be done in an oven. Also, proteins can be replaced but should be one layer on the rice.",

  "directions": "1 Preheat the grill or oven to 375ºF.\n\nSteep saffron In a saucepan over medium heat and bring stock to a boil. Add saffron and salt. Turn off heat and steep saffron for 15 minutes. Season with salt.\n\nIn a cast iron skillet, heat oil, sauté onion and red pepper until soft. (5 min or so) Add garlic and chorizo.\n\nPut the skillet on the grill or to stove. Add rice and stir until coated with oil and lightly toasted. 4 min or so.\n\nAdd stock and tomato. Add salt. Salt is difficult because the sauce will reduce and the rice will absorb, but error on the side of slightly salty at this point.\n\nClose grill cover or oven door and simmer rice for 15 min or so until the stock is absorbed. If necessary, add boiling water. Do not stir.\n\nAdd seafood. Mussels and clams should be hinge side up so the juices go into the rice.\n\nCover pan with foil and close grill or oven and cook for 6 - 10 min until rice and shrimp are done.\n\nRemove when done and sprinkle with parsley.\n\nServe in the pan.",
