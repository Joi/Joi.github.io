Don’t fuss with the salmon while it cooks.\n\nAs a little cheat, look at the side of your filet. There should be no appearance of rawness in the middle. As the cooked salmon converges in the center of the cross-section of your filet as you sear each side, you’ll be able to get a decent sense of when your salmon is cooked.\n\nWhile the salmon is cooking, in a small bowl, mix together the water, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and salt. Set aside.\n\nTransfer the cooked filets to a plate. In the same pan you seared the salmon in, add 2 tablespoons of oil, and lightly fry the ginger until crisp. Add the scallions and cook until wilted, followed by the prepared soy sauce mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, and turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve the salmon, place on a bed of rice, and spoon the scallion and ginger evenly over the salmon. Pour the sauce over the top, and sprinkle with the chopped cilantro.",
