  "directions": "The Dressing:\n\nChop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.\n\nDO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead.\n\nThe Croutons:\n\nMake your own. Tearing, not cutting the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes.\n\nThe Lettuce:\n\nUse whole leaves; they provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.\n\nThe Cheese:\n\nCaesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.\n\nThe Assembly\n\nSkip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parm.",
