  "description": "A RICHLY FLAVORED PANFRY THAT HAS A PUNGENT, DELICIOUS AROMA. “Sea beans” are glasswort, a crunchy, briny marsh succulent. We use fresh sea beans in the late spring when they are briefly in season, and pickled ones the rest of the year {see Pickled Glasswort, here}. You can substitute capers or caperberries. In lieu of sand dabs, a mild, succulent flatfish that is a San Francisco delicacy, you can use small, whole, pan-ready sole or flounder. By “pan-ready,” I mean gutted, scaled, head and tail removed, and fins trimmed. Filleted fish is an option as well, but adjust the cooking time accordingly, and be prepared for it to curl as it cooks. Skate wing is another good choice~the skate in black butter of French tradition is the obvious inspiration for this dish.\n\nA large nonstick skillet is the best choice here. If you don’t have one, clarify half of the butter {see Note below} before you brown the fish in it {or any time you plan to pan-brown a wet protein or starch in butter}. To keep wet fish from sticking to a non-nonstick pan, you need to use higher heat, and the solids in whole butter would burn at that temperature. Clarifying also removes the water, which makes food stick, from the butter.\n\nIf you are new to panfrying fragile things, you should opt for the larger fish~it will be easier to manage 4 sizzling, slippery objects than 8. Serve with new potatoes, boiled or steamed in their skins.",

  "directions": "Briefly rinse the fish and pat dry. Lightly salt them all over. {You can do this step up to a few hours in advance; if you do, cover the fish loosely and refrigerate.}\n\nTen minutes to an hour before cooking the fish, pat dry again and dredge in flour. Tap to remove the excess flour, arrange, barely touching one another, on a platter or sheet pan, and refrigerate. This will help set the crust for easier handling and less flour will shed into, and taint, the pan sauce.\n\nHeat about half of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. When it has melted and separated, but before it begins to color, give the fish a last flourshedding tap and gently lay them in the pan; they should sizzle on contact. Don’t try to move the fish until they have set a crust. Cook until golden on both sides and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side, adjusting the time if your fish are thicker or thinner than 1/2 inch. Monitor closely, and reduce the heat if the butter is threatening to color beyond golden, or raise it if the fish are not coloring at all. Turn the fish gently, trying not to crack the golden crust; I lift and turn them with a metal spatula, nudging with a wooden spoon so they land where I want them to. When the fish are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and transfer to warm plates or a platter. Protect from drafts while you concoct the simple pan sauce.\n\nPour off the butter if it is darker than hazelnut colored. Return the pan to medium-low heat and add the remaining butter, the shallots, and glasswort, caperberries, or capers. Cook, stirring constantly, until the shallots have just lost their raw edge. Raise the heat slightly and add the vinegar. Taste as it comes to a boil, but it shouldn’t need salt~the briny wort or capers will likely provide enough. Spoon over the fish and serve piping hot, while the heady aroma of brown butter and evaporating vinegar is still concentrated.\n\nNote: To clarify butter, melt the butter in your smallest, narrowest saucepan, or a butter warmer, over low heat. Monitor it as it comes to a controlled, quiet simmer, then let it bubble for a minute. Pull from the heat and leave to settle and separate, which should take 10 minutes or less. Skim the surface, then gently tilt the pan and pour the clear yellow butter off the water and solids at the bottom of the pan. WHOLE",
