Spray the ribs with olive oil and sprinkle with smoked salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, onion powder and garlic powder.\n\nBake the ribs for 1 hour.\n\nMix the apple cider vinegar marinade again, then pour it into three small bowls, dividing it evenly. Baste the tops of the ribs with 1/3 of the marinade.\n\nReturn the ribs to the oven and bake them for three more hours, basting the top with 1/3 of the marinade every hour (make sure you rinse the basting brush after each basting with hot soapy water).\n\nAfter 4 hours of baking, the ribs should be nicely browned and very tender. At this point you can serve them, but to make them even better, reduce the oven to 200 degrees F, and keep them in the oven for one more hour.
