  "directions": "Thaw the frozen beef tongue naturally. If you are using a fresh one, it will be very tender when it's done.\n\nParboil the tongue with vegetables. Then let it cool naturally in water used for cooking. When it has cooled, peel the skin and cut into your desired thickness.\n\nPrepare the stew. Stir fry aromatic vegetables and add enough water to cover and simmer. The aromatic vegetables include carrot, celery, shallots, garlic, etc.\n\nWhile you are simmering the stew, add mashed canned tomatoes. Simmer until it has reduced by half. Boil down 2 cups of red wine before you add it to the stew. Add the wine and strain. Then add the canned demi-glace sauce (optional).\n\nSaute flour in butter slowly until it has turned dark brown. Add water used for cooking the tongue to make a roux. It should look like this as shown in the photo. Dissolve the roux into the stew (Step 4). Season with Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper and sugar.\n\nPut the cooked tongue into the stew. If you used a frozen tongue, it will be very tender if you leave it to stand overnight. Serve with sautéed spinach or pasta.",
