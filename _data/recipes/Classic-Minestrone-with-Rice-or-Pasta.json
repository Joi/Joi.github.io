  "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nAdding pasta or rice makes this hearty soup appropriate as a dinner. If the soup seems too thick after adding the pasta or rice, stir in a little water. Pasta and rice do not hold up well when refrigerated or frozen, so serve this soup as soon as the pasta or rice is tender.\n\nBring vegetables, tomatoes, water, cheese rind, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in a soup kettle or pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but still hold their shape, about 1 hour. Add arborio rice or pasta and continue cooking until rice is tender but still a bit firm in the center of each grain, about 20 minutes, or until pasta is al dente, 8 to 12 minutes, depending on shape.\n\nAdd beans and cook just until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Remove and discard cheese rind. Stir in pesto (or rosemary-garlic mixture). Adjust seasonings, adding pepper and more salt, if necessary. Ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately.",
