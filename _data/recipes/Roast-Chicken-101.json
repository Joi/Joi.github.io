  "directions": "1. Spatchcock the chicken\n\nSpatchcock the chicken. Turn the bird onto its breast and use a pair of heavy duty kitchen shears to cut along either side of the backbone, removing it completely.\n\n2. Break the breastbone\n\nThen turn the chicken over and press on the sternum to crack it so the bird lays flat. Tuck the wing tips inwards on themselves and spread the legs out so the dark meat gets plenty of exposure to the heat.\n\n3. Salt all sides\n\nPat the bird dry, removing as much moisture as possible, especially from the skin. Starting on the underside, salt the chicken liberally all around.\n\n4. Season the skin\n\nTurn the chicken skin-side-up and sprinkle the skin evenly with granulated garlic and paprika.\n\n5. Refrigerate overnight\n\nRefrigerate the chicken, uncovered, overnight, up to 24 hours. The low-humidity air of the refrigerator will dry out the skin, which is critical for achieving crispy skin in the searing step.\n\n7. Prepare the sheet pans\n\nLine the solid pan with foil. This pan will sit on the bottom rack to catch the drippings. This recipe works best when the there’s some airflow underneath the chicken. Use the perforated pan (sold as an accessory) or a pan with a wire rack. Grease the pan with high smoke point oil, such as grapeseed. Transfer the chicken to the pan, skin-side-up.\n\n8. Insert the food probe\n\nLift the skin on the crown end of the chicken to reveal the breast meat. Insert the food sensor into the thickest part of the breast, making sure not to pierce the skin.\n\n9. Put into the oven\n\nPlace the foil-covered pan in the bottom position, and the perforated pan with chicken in the middle position. Connect the other end of the food sensor to the oven.\n\n10. Cook to Core\n\nWith Sous Vide Mode target of 63°C/145°F, the chicken will gently glide into perfect doneness in a little more than 2 hours, but without any risk of overcooking. If you prefer to speed up cooking, you can increase the wet bulb set point to 73°C/163°F, which will reduce the cooking time to around 1h, depending on the size of the bird. In either case, remove the chicken when the probe reaches it's target. Target 63°C/145°F for very juicy meat, or use the higher heat setting above and adjust the target to 68°C/155°F for a more traditional texture. After the probe reaches its target, you can drop the wet bulb temperature to 61°C/142°F to hold the chicken up to 3 hours until you're ready to sear and serve.\n\n11. Remove from oven\n\nRemove the chicken tray and drip tray from the oven. Remove the probe from the chicken.\n\n12. Preheat for searing\n\nRemoving the chicken before preheating ensures that the meat doesn't overcook before the oven is hot enough for searing.\n\n13. Brush with oil\n\nWhile the oven is preheating, brush or spray the chicken’s skin with high smoke point oil, like grapeseed. This will help the skin crisp and brown evenly.\n\n14. Put back into the oven\n\nPlace both pans in the oven in their same positions.\n\n15. Sear\n\nWhen the oven has reached temperature, add the drip tray back to the bottom rack and place the chicken and perforated tray on the middle rack. Roast for 10 minutes, or until the skin is dark and golden brown. Keep a close eye on the chicken during the last 5 minutes of roasting in particular, as the skin can go from perfectly golden to dark in a short time. The oven may get smoky during this stage from drippings pyrolyzing, and that’s OK – it’s adding flavor back to the bird.\n\n16. Remove from oven\n\nCarefully remove both pans from the oven.\n\n17. Pour over drippings\n\nStack the pan with the chicken over another pan, and immediately use the pan of hot drippings to pour over the skin. This will help additionally crisp and season the skin.\n\n18. Rest and carve\n\nRest the chicken for 5-10 minutes. Then separate the legs and carve the breasts, taking care to keep the crispy skin attached to the meat.\n\n19. Slice\n\nCut the breast meat into slices for easier serving.\n\n20. Enjoy!\n\nPrecise moisture control retains juices, while convection crisps the skin. Serve this perfect chicken with your favorite side dishes for the best home-cooked meal ever.",
