  "description": "THIS IS AN EASY, CROWD-PLEASING DISH I OWE TO MADELEINE SERRAILLE, SISTER of the famous frères Troisgros. It is one of the distracting dishes her brother Jean would sniff and sample when he happened by her house on his way back to the restaurant to cook salmon in sorrel sauce and steak à la moelle. Madeleine claimed it was from Ali-Bab’s Gastronomie Pratique, an idiosyncratic elevenpound treasury of French cooking that she insisted I buy and study the summer before I went to college.\n\nAïoli gives this dish richness along with a jolt of garlic; a lighter alternative is to rub the hot toasted bread with raw garlic.\n",

  "directions": "Seasoning the chicken (for the best flavor and succulence, do this step 12 to 24 hours in advance):\n\nTrim the excess fat, then season the chicken evenly all over with salt {we use 3/4 teaspoon sea salt per pound of chicken}. Cover loosely and refrigerate. Combine the onions with the oil and a few pinches of salt in a 4-quart saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently so they do not color, until the onions are nutty-tender and translucent and have fallen to half their former mass, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the bay leaf, thyme, and chili, breaking the pod in half if you want the bouillabaisse to be a little spicier. Add the white wine and boil for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, saffron, garlic, and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the 4 or 2 chicken legs and bring back to a simmer. Skim any foam.\n\nAdjust the heat to maintain a quiet simmer and cook uncovered for about 1 hour, stirring once or twice. If using a cut-up chicken, add the breasts after about 30 minutes of cooking time. The chicken should be quite tender, but not falling off the bone.\n\nMeanwhile, grill or toast the bread. Spread each warm slice with about 1 tablespoon of Aïoli, if using, and place in a warm bowl.\n\nLightly skim the surface of the bouillabaisse, then raise the heat and boil vigorously for 1 minute. Place a piece of chicken on each toast and moisten with the golden, oniony broth. Offer the remaining aïoli as a garnish. ",
