  "directions": "Tear the sorrel into smallish, bite-sized pieces, or use a really sharp knife to slice into ¼-inch wide strips on the diagonal. If the knife isn’t sharp, just tear it up. This helps the sorrel to not bruise.\n\nHeat a good-sized heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, adding the shallots, wine, vermouth, dashi-kombu, and stock to the pot all at once. Bring to a boil and adjust heat so it comes to a gently simmer. Cook down until the liquid is getting thick, almost syrupy.\n\nPull the pan from the heat and remove the dashi-kombu, discarding or saving for another use.\n\nReturn the pan to the heat and add the crème fraiche or heavy cream. If using the former, cook just longer enough until it is thickened to just coat the back of a spoon. If using cream, this will take a bit longer, but simmer until the cream will lightly coat the back of a spoon.\n\nScatter the sorrel over the sauce and wilt the sorrel for 25 seconds. Pull the pan from the heat and add the butter, swirling the pan to melt and incorporate the butter into an emulsion. If you think you need to stir the sauce, use a wooden spoon, not a whisk, which will catch the sorrel. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a few drops of lemon juice and taste. The lemon juice should add a spark to the sauce. Add more if you think it needs it.\n\nUse the sauce right away as it suffers if allowed to sit. If you need to, you can make the sauce up to the point where you remove the dashi-kombu. Then you can finish it quickly at the last minute.",
