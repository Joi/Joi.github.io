Add the chicken stock and return the oxtails to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, cover, and cook until the meat is starting to fall off the bones, 3 to 3½ hours.\n3.\tUsing tongs, transfer the oxtails to a large bowl. When they are cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones; discard the bones. Transfer the meat to a sealable storage container.\n4.\tStrain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium saucepan. Carefully skim the excess fat from the top with a ladle. Spoon a few tablespoons of the liquid over the shredded meat and season the meat to taste with salt and pepper; cover the meat and liquid and refrigerate until ready to serve. (Reheat the meat in the microwave or in a skillet before serving; see Note above.)\n5.\tShortly before serving the roast, return the strained braising liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes.
