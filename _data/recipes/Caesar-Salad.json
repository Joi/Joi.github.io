Remove simmering basket with spatula and place eggs under cold running water to stop the cooking process.\n\nPeel eggs, separate egg whites from egg yolks (see Tip), reserve yolks for dressing. Chop egg whites into small cubes and set aside.\n\nSet oven to broil, low setting. Place oven rack in middle of oven.\n\nPlace a bowl onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in bread cubes. Place bread cubes onto a baking sheet, drizzle olive oil over bread cubes and mix with spatula. Place baking sheet under broiler, turn bread cubes carefully while baking until golden brown and set aside.\n\nPlace a large salad bowl onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in lettuce. Add croutons (bread cubes) and chopped egg whites to large salad bowl and set aside.\n\nDressing\n\nPlace a pitcher onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in 5 oz olive oil. Set aside.\n\nPlace Parmesan cheese into mixing bowl and grate 5 sec/speed 7. Set scale to zero, then using a spoon, remove 3.5 oz of Parmesan cheese (scale will show minus '- 3.5 oz') and reserve for sprinkling on finished salad. Grate the remaining 2 oz of cheese a further 10 sec/speed 10.\n\nAdd garlic, anchovy fillets, mustard, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, 3.5 oz olive oil and reserved egg yolks and mix 20 sec/speed 7. Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula.\n\nMix 1 min/speed 5 while pouring the reserved 5 oz of olive oil in a slow steady stream onto mixing bowl lid, letting it drizzle around the measuring cup onto rotating blades to an emulsion. Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula.\n\nAdd water and stir 5 sec/speed 3. Pour half the dressing (see Tip) over Caesar Salad and serve immediately.\n\nTips & tricks\n\nEggs should be soft boiled: egg yolk liquid, egg whites just cooked.\n\nThis recipe makes enough dressing for two salads. Add as much dressing as you wish and store the rest for up to one week in the refrigerator.\n\nParmesan cheese can be reserved and added to salad before serving.",
