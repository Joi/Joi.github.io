  "description": "Take a page out of the French farmwife’s handbook and keep confit on hand to save you from dinnertime desperation. Easy enough to make while you watch a movie or do the Sunday crossword, there’s no reason not to try this recipe. I make a big batch once or twice each winter. I just stick it in the fridge, where it quickly makes its way to the back of the bottom shelf, a spot I rarely think to look. But I inevitably find it just when I need it most—when an unexpected friend shows up for dinner, or I just can’t muster the energy to cook. And, every time, I give silent thanks to that thoughtful, industrious earlier version of myself. You will, too.\n\nIf you can’t find or make duck fat, pure olive oil will work just fine. But if you do make the effort to find or render your own duck fat, you’ll be rewarded in flavor. (There aren’t many other uses for duck fat in the kitchen, but for roasting or frying potatoes, the excess fat from confit is an unforgettable one.) Serve the chicken and potatoes with a pile of arugula or chicories dressed in a bright, Honey-Mustard Vinaigrette (page 240 ) and spoonfuls of Herb Salsa for a welcome acidic contrast.",

  "directions": "Prep the chicken a day in advance. Use a sharp knife to slit the skin at the base around each drumstick, just above the ankle joint. Cut all the way around, down to the bone, making sure to sever the tendons. Season with salt and pepper. Layer in a dish with the thyme, cloves, bay leaves, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\n\nTo prepare, remove the aromatics and lay the legs into a large Dutch oven or pot in a single layer. If using duck or chicken fat, warm gently in a medium saucepan just until it liquefies. Pour enough fat into the Dutch oven or pot to submerge the meat, and then heat over a medium flame until the first bubbles emerge from the chicken. Reduce the heat so that the fat never surpasses the slightest simmer. Cook until the meat is tender at the bone, about 2 hours. (Alternatively, cook the whole thing in the oven, at about 200°F. Use the same cues to guide you as in stovetop simmering.)\n\nWhen the meat is cooked, turn off the heat and let it cool in the fat for a little while. Using metal tongs, carefully remove the chicken from the fat. Grab the bone at the ankle end to avoid tearing the skin.\n\nLet the meat and fat cool, then place the chicken into a glass or ceramic dish, strain the fat over it, ensuring it’s completely submerged. Cover with a lid. Store in the fridge for up to 6 months.\n\nTo serve, remove the chicken from the fat, scraping off excess. Heat a cast iron pan over a medium flame, and place chicken, skin-side down, into the pan. As with Conveyor Belt Chicken , use the weight of a second, foil-wrapped cast iron pan to help render the fat and crisp the skin. Place the pan on top of the chicken and heat gently to crisp the skin at the same rate the meat reheats. As you start to hear crackles, rather than sizzles, pay closer attention to the meat so it doesn’t burn. Once the skin is browned, flip the chicken and continue reheating the leg on the second side without a weight. The whole process will take about 15 minutes.\n\nServe immediately.\n\nVariations\n\n• For Duck Confit , cook 2 1 /2 to 3 hours, until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.\n\n• For Turkey Confit , increase duck fat to 9 cups and cook 3 to 3 1 /2 hours, until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.\n\n• For Pork Confit , season 1 /2 -pound pieces of pork shoulder as above and replace the duck fat with lard or olive oil.",
