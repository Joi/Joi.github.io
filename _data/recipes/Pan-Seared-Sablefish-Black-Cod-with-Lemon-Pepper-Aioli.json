It will be our secret.\n\nCombine egg yolk with mustard, lemon juice, zest, garlic, salt and pepper. In a slow and steady stream, add the oils until the mixture is emulsified. This can be done in a food processor, blender, or by hand with a whisk. Set aside.\n\nFOR THE SABLEFISH:\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, preferably non-stick, skillet. Season fish generously with salt and pepper. Cook skin-side down for 4-5 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Gently turn fish and cook another 2-3 minutes. Set fish aside to rest.\n\nFOR THE GREENS:\n\nAdjust heat to medium, and add 3 tablespoons olive oil to the same skillet. Quickly sauté garlic and red pepper flakes, approximately 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add greens to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Use tongs to move the chard around the pan to wilt evenly. Add lemon juice just before serving.",
