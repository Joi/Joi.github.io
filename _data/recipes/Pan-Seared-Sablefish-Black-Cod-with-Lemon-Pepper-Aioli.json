Set fish aside to rest.\n\nFOR THE GREENS:\n\nAdjust heat to medium, and add 3 tablespoons olive oil to the same skillet. Quickly sauté garlic and red pepper flakes, approximately 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add greens to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Use tongs to move the chard around the pan to wilt evenly.
