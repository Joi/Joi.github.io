  "directions": "Remove any brown or wilted leaves on the outside of the cabbage. Cut the cabbage head into 6 pieces and remove the thick stems at the core. In a large bowl (or a container) place the cabbage pieces, making sure they fit snugly.\n\nIn a medium bowl prep the brine by adding the pre-boiled and cooled water, salt, sugar, 70% vinegar, oil, bay leaves, peppercorns. Mix all the spices well.\n\nChop up (or crush) garlic cloves and distribute them among the cabbage pieces evenly. Pour the ready brine mixture over the cabbage pieces.\n\nCover the cabbages (not the container) with a lid or a big enough plate. It should be just big enough to cover the cabbages and keep them under press when something put on top. Now, find something which can be used as a pressing tool and can be placed on top of the lid. I used my 10-lb dumbbell, which was perfect.\n\nKeep the cabbages under press, at room temperature for 3 days. When the time is up, open up the press and taste the awesomeness! At this time your cabbage is ready for consumption. Once ready, keep the pickled cabbages refrigerated.\n\nViola! Enjoy and let me know how yours turned out :)\n\nNOTE: 70% vinegar essence can be found in many Russian, European or international stores. Be very careful with it though. The usual white vinegar we have in U.S. stores are only 6% in acidity. If ingested 70% vinegar essence can be deadly. If you buy some for the kitchen use, please make absolute sure that it is out of reach for everyone in your household.\n\nRemove any brown or wilted leaves on the outside of the cabbage.
