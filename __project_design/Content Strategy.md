Where/when can a visitor see what?

Meals
- Meals are our 1st class objects.
	They are listed prominently on the homepage, and featured.
- Meals are dated.

Recipes
- Recipes come in two general classes:
		1. Joi's & 5 stars and
		2. All the rest
	The first are surfaced explicitly, in indexes, homepage listings, etcâ€¦
	The second play a supporting role. They may appear auto-linked from a Meal, 
	or "[[]]" linked by Joi in the text of any other page type on the site.

# Documenting Contexts

## Homepage

## Meal Note Page
Jekyll Anchor: Meal Note Markdown+YAML file (Handwritten in Obsidian)

Relations:
- To Recipe
	- via Data Indice "recipe_by_date_and_meal"
		i.e.: Meal Date & Meal Type -> Recipe PID


## Recipe Page
Jekyll Anchor: Recipe Markdown+YAML stub generated by Python from Paprika

Relations:
- To Meal Note
	- via Data Indice "meal_by_recipe_and_date"
		i.e.: Recipe ID -> Meal Date & Type

Special:
List of Meals grouped by 
1. featured? (Note YAML)
2. not featured? (Note YAML)
3. Meal exists but Note does not (Paprika but not Markdown)
_Python Script does not know about Note YAML nor Note in FS_

Replace
```
"RecipePID": {
	"yyyy-mm-dd": "type",
	"yyyy-mm-dd": "type"
	}
}
```
with
```
"RecipePID": {
	"yyyy-mm-dd--type": {
		"file": true/false
		"feature": "Feature Title" _(or full YAML)_
	},
	"yyyy-mm-dd--type": {
		"file": true/false
		"feature": "Feature Title" _(or full YAML)_
	},
}
```

And/Or
Create new index:

```
"RecipeID": {
	"featured": [
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type", "feature":"Feature Title},
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type", "feature":"Feature Title}
	],
	"regular": [
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type"},
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type"}
	],
	"no file": [
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type"},
		{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "type": "type"}
	]
}
```
