Everyone liked the BBQ spare ribs last week so this week I'm going to try to make smoked ribs. I found St. Louis style ribs at Savenor's so I decided to try that. People swear by the cut which is half way between the baby back ribs and the spare ribs. They are supposed to be shaped like baby back, but have the robustness of the spare ribs.

I'm also going to try to smoke them on my Weber grill. I've had problems keeping the fire going at low heat without the fire going out so this will be a challenge - to slow cook them and keep the fire going but low. I'm going to try using [[binchotan]] with some lump hardwood charcoal as a backup. If these turn out well and people like the smoked taste, I might consider buying a airflow controller for the grill to try to get the grill to auto-regulate the temperature, but I'm going to hold off until I confirm people want smoked meat and I can do it by hand first.
