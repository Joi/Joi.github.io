On a BBQ kick since the ribs and because I still had some of the [[A-Very-Popular-BBQ-Sauce]] left, I decided to try doing a BBQ chicken. I looked around for various recipes and I found ["The Best Barbecue Chicken Recipe"](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/the-best-barbecue-chicken-recipe.html) by Kenji Lopez-Alt, author of [The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab). It was basically a reverse sear using the cooler side of the grill to slow roast the chicken before moving it to the high heat side to sear. He had a strange warning on the recipe:

>Note: This recipe calls for a large chicken. Do not try it with a smaller chicken, as it will dry out too much while cooking.

I'm not sure why it would get dry with this reverse sear-like thing. Maybe the temperature was hot, but even at 400+ºF, it would be similar to the oven roasted spatchcocked chicken we always make. I ordered the [Giannone chicken](http://giannonepoultry.com/en/) from [Savenor's](https://www.savenorsmarket.com/) so the largest was 3 1/2 lb, too small by Kenji's standards. I decided to give it a try anyway. [I posted the question on the website. (I'm jonkichi)](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/the-best-barbecue-chicken-recipe.html#comment-anchor-43758)

Also, my second order of [binchotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binch%C5%8Dtan) had come so I tried for the first time to do an all binchotan grill. The pieces were long and some stuck out of the end of the chimney so I had to turn them around part way through. After they looked lit, I put them in the grill, put the chicken in and closed the top with the vent half-closed. After awhile, it was clear that it wasn't hot enough and they seemed to be cooling off. I added two remaining pieces of binchotan and started fanning them with a Japanese fan. Later I put the top on and fanned from underneath, which worked. It was Mizuka's idea and similar to [The Modernist Cuisine](https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/) idea of using a blow drying under the grill to air the coals.

Once it got going the binchotan worked well and survived until the end with most of the coal still left. Closed with the vents open, the grill hovered at about 410ºF. After cutting off the oxygen, we used a tiny little part that was still burning for the smores.

Because of this little intermission to heat the coals, it took much longer than expected and threw off my timing so I'm not sure how accurate the recipe is. However, everything turned out great. The breast was very juicy and not dried out.

The Modernist Cuisine has an idea for burgers to put a pan of ice on the cool side of the grill to circulate steam. Maybe I'll try that next time. Definitely very tasty chicken - very different from the plain oven roasted chicken that we'd been making every week.

Next up, I'll try adding some hardwood chips to try smoking the chicken as well.
