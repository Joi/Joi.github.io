After reading [Food Lab](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/), I decided to try [J. Kenji López-Alt's formula for cooking salmon](/recipes/Ultra-Crisp-Skinned-Pan-Roasted-Fish-Fillets.html). The idea is that the fish need to cook slowly to 125ºF or so and that the fat by the skin will slow the heat from a pan.

So the formula is to heat a skillet with a bit of oil and put the fish on the skillet skin-side down and turn down the temperature to low at the same time. The skin will sear and not stick to the skillet and then then the fish will cook slowly. Flip the fish to the presentation-side down near the end until the temperature is perfect and then remove the fish.

It worked pretty well with the salmon which was only seasoned with salt and pepper. The sear was nicer than the broiled salmon I tried last time.
