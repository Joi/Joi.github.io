I have four 1 Â½ lb lobsters today and after googling around I find a range of recipes for steaming them starting 9-11 min at [Lobster Anywhere](https://lobsteranywhere.com/cooking-lobster/) and up to 14 min according to [Lobster from Maine](https://lobsteranywhere.com/cooking-lobster/). You'd think that steaming would be approximately the same amount of time since the temperature is probably roughly the same? I guess maybe not. Or maybe it is about the preferred "doneness." But both recipes are American. I guess I'll try 11 min and see how it goes.1
