title: My First Tuna Confit
---
I used a mashup of this [recipe for Tuna Confit](/food/recipe_list/Recipes/Master%20Recipe%20for%20Tuna%20Confit.html) and the recipe in [Samin Nosrat's book Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/). I prepared the olive oil aromatics in the Dutch Oven and instead of cooling it down, I kept it at 150ÂºF and added the tuna and cooked it for 9 min and a bit. The Nosrat recipe said to salt the tuna and then add it to the oil rather what the [Fine Cooking recipe](/food/recipe_list/Recipes/Master%20Recipe%20for%20Tuna%20Confit.html) said - to salt the oil. In hindsight, I should have done that.

None the less, the tuna came out great. I could have pulled the tuna at exactly 9 min instead of waiting the extra min or so since it cooked a fair amount after being pulled and JUST pink is probably best.

Also, I realize that I could do it in a sous vide and waste less oil.

It reminds me of what the origin of canned tuna was - a preserved tuna that's tasty and easy to eat.
