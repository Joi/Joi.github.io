I've been studying zettelkasten, which is a note taking method that helps you organizing your thoughts and notes in a way that creates an emergent structure that improves the way you write, think and create new ideas. It's powerful, but complex.

This website is becoming a testing ground for some of the organizational and process ideas.

One way to think about it is as a kind of *Choose Your Own Adventure* (CYOA) site. Each zettel is supposed to be a kind of atomic unit of idea. One idea per note with links to other notes. Theoretically, traversing from note to note should take the reader (or writer) along a train of thought that is somewhat coherent going from association to association. I think "associatively" when I'm allowing myself to be creative and this structure feels good to me. Thinking about writing for a CYOA book is interesting and very different than blogging. It is very much like putting together a wiki but with an intent that someone might sit down and have a journey rather than just use it as a reference.

I wonder if I can somehow construct the site (with Boris's help ðŸ˜„ ) that allows me to keep adding and for there to be many entries into the work without it feeling like a site of just reference material. I suppose it has a lot to do with the content and the tone.
