The daughter of our housemates really liked the Spatchcocked Chicken last week so we decided that we should make it again this week. It would add more fodder for my stock bag in the freezer and would help me work on perfecting the recipe. Since we need to make it today, we'll get a chance to taste it without an overnight brining to see if we can taste the difference. (We should do this side-by-side sometime.)

One thing that I noticed was that we have fresh herbs expiring on different cycles and I noticed that the [Salsa Verde](/recipes/Basic-Salsa-Verde.html) and various herb sauces in Salt Fat Acid Heat were pretty flexible and great for side sauces for things like the Spatchkocked Chicken.

We have extra parsley and sage today so I'll make the Salsa Verde and possibly fry the sage and make the [Fried Sage Salsa Verde](/recipes/Fried-Sage-Salsa-Verde.html) if I have time.
