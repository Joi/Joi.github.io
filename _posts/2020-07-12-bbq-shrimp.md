Today's another BBQ day.

Here's the current thinking on the recipes:

#### Grilled Shrimp

##### Ingredients
- garlic
- salt
- pepper
- olive oil
- paprika
- lemon
Soak skewers so they don't burn. Towel-dry garlic, a and marinate with olive oil, salt, epper, paprika, garlic and lemon. Grill. Pretty straight forward. I might add some parsely at the end for a herb smell and look.

#### Burgers
##### Ingredients
- 2 lb ground beef
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp minced onions
- 1 tbsp Wocestershire sauce
- 1 3/4 tsp ground pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp salt

#### Grilled Sirloin Steak
Salt and pepper seasoned and stuck in the fridge this morning. Will just grill and serve with hot sauce and aioli sauce on the side.
