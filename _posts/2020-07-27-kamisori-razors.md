As I tumble down the rat hole of [[sharpening-and-honing]], I stumbled into the rat hole that is Japanese kamisori razors. They are similar to the straight single edged razors in the West, but they only have one side beveled - similar to Japanese swords. Apparently the were introduced into Japan when monks brought razors to shave their heads. Shaving men's faces came with the Western influence of the Meiji Restoration. The Japanese *kamisori* or razor is made like a Japanese knife or sword. When low cost sharp razors came onto the market, *kamisori* mostly disappeared. Sharpening them takes a long time and a lot of expertise and they are expensive to make.

However, there is a kind of cult following in the West and people obsessively hone and shave with *kamisori*. Mizuka Googled in Japanese and there are still a few barbershops in Japan that use them, but they are mostly out of circulation. The Japanese website also noted that they are a "thing" among Western *otaku*. :-)

As I dig into sharpening and honing I end up in forums where people are talking about whetstones and the conversation inevitably leads you to the razor honing community.

I've never really needed lots of razors because I don't have a lot of facial hair, but I'm going to give a *kamisori* a try. Most *kamisori* on Esty or eBay are antiques (as are many Japanese whetstones) because they don't make or use them so much anymore. The good thing is that if you sharpen up an old *kamisori*, it should be as good as new. Luckily, stones also don't spoil with age, but they do become expensive.
