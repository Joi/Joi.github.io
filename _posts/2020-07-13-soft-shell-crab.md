We ordered 4 soft-shell crabs from Savenor's and I cooked them based on a [Martha Stewart recipe](/recipes/Pan-Fried-Soft-Shell-Crabs.html). Mizuka doesn't like to waste oil so I didn't put as much as in the recipe. They came out OK, but were a bit soggier than I'd want - I think the temperature went down. I think that I could either fry fewer crabs at a time (I put 4 in the pan), use more oil or make it hotter before adding the crabs. I think I'll try all of these things the next time.
