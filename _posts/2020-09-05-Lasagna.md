I had a request for lasagna from the family with the constraint that one of the diners didn't like ricotta cheese.

Lasagna used to be an old favorite to make, but I haven't made it in quite awhile.

Time to do some research.

**Some recipes**

- [A nice recipe that basically replaces ricotta cheese with Béchamel](https://cafedelites.com/best-lasagna/) - Maybe I'll make this my base
- [A recipe that boasts being the best. Uses Italian sausage and takes 3 1/4 hours](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23600/worlds-best-lasagna/) - It looks like 1 1/2 hour of it is making the meat sauce. Maybe I can use the pressure cooker pattern from the pressure cooker Ragú recipe to shorten that
- [More spices and bell peppers as well as wine](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/lasagna/)
- [Nice simple recipe with good tips](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-homemade-lasagna/)

And now working on [[Jois-Lasagna|my own recipe]] based on these.
