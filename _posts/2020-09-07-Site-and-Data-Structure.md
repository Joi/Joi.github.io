As my cooking has taken on a bit more complexity and structure, I realize that the recipe and post structure isn't really exactly right. What I need is:

1. Recipes from other sources (with filter for copyrighted parts - maybe ultimately just links to the sources)
2. My own recipes that would continue to evolve and be updated as I innovate and learn. Would be great if these could have links back to posts and a log of updates.
3. Posts documenting experiments - cooking sessions. Some are multi-day so need to figure out how to log multi-day/multi-part experiments. Should they be one post or a series of posts?
4. Topic pages. For example, ["emulsion"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion), [[2020-08-02-reverse-sear|"reverse sear,"]] ["Maillard reaction"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) or ["binchotan"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binch%C5%8Dtan). These are methods, ideas, materials, etc. They're topics often referenced in posts and recipes but that don't make sense to elaborate each time. Would be great if we could link and even create a hover over summary for posts and recipes and to have links to posts and recipes from the topics.

In many ways, the posts are what generate "assertions" in [Underlay](https://www.underlay.org/) parlance.

It seems like the original recipes and topic pages could be something like a wiki or an Underlay overlay. Also, many of the topics are dynamic and could be coded. For example, unit conversion or substitutions.

Boris is experimenting with using tags or categories to help link the various pieces together.
