Today I am cooking a 4.24 lb Prime Rib from compared with 3.23 lb for [[2020-08-17-prime-rib|my previous one]]. I wonder if I can predict how long it will take other things being equal. The first result on Google for "time for roasting prime rib by weight" returns [an article](https://www.today.com/food/world-s-easiest-prime-rib-roast-master-holiday-classic-t77026) that says 15 min / pound which suggests that the time scales proportional to weight.

$$ rate = \frac{time_1}{weight_1}$$
$$ rate = \frac{5 \operatorname{hrs}}{3.23 \operatorname{lb}} = 1.55 \operatorname{hrs}\operatorname{per}\operatorname{lb}$$
$$ time_2 = rate * 4.24 \operatorname{lbs}$$
$$ x = 6.56 \operatorname{hrs} $$


Theoretically.

Interesting also to note that their rate, 0.25 hrs per lb is at 325ºF and I am cooking at 170ºF at 1.5 hrs / lb or 6 times as long at 155ºF less temperature.

I'm going to try to do it using convection bake mode vs roast mode to see if it will roast it more evenly. I've also put the prime rib on a higher rack to try to cook it more evenly as well. This will probably throw the time off, we'll see.

#### My log

| Time | Note|
| --- | --- |
| 10:15 AM | Put Prime Rib into oven set at 170ºF Convection Bake
| 1:30 PM | Internal temperature hit 130ºF so removed it and foiled |

That's only 3.25 hours, which is much shorter than the 5 hours last time. Hopefully the convection heating hasn't made it tougher. My guess is that rack allowed it to warm from all directions which should theoretically make it more tender since no one side should have gotten as hot.
