Today I am cooking a 4.24 lb Prime Rib from compared with 3.23 lb for [[2020-08-17-prime-rib|my previous one]]. I wonder if I can predict how long it will take other things being equal. The first result on Google for "time for roasting prime rib by weight" returns [an article](https://www.today.com/food/world-s-easiest-prime-rib-roast-master-holiday-classic-t77026) that says 15 min / pound which suggests that the time scales proportional to weight.

$$ rate = \frac{time_1}{weight_1}$$
$$ rate = \frac{5\:hrs}{3.23\:lb} = 1.55\:hrs\:per\:lb$$
$$ time_2 = rate * 4.24\:lbs$$
$$ x = 6.56 \: hrs $$

Theoretically.

Interesting also to note that their rate, 0.25 hrs per lb is at 325ºF and I am cooking at 170ºF at 1.5 hrs per lb or 6 times as long at 155ºF less temperature.
