With plenty of time and my new cooking skills and tools, I hope this year's turkey will be good.

[Kenji Lopez says to cook the turkey for 3-4 hours at 300ºF for a 10-12 lb turkey](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/11/the-best-simple-roast-turkey-gravy-recipe.html). I found another [recipe that says 10 hours at 250ºF for a 12 - 16lb turkey](https://nourishedkitchen.com/slow-roast-turkey/). This recipe says, "It’s okay to cook the bird over temperature. The meat will seize and then yield and become even more tender as it cooks, so I typically cook my bird to 180 F." That goes against many people who argue that you shouldn't let the chicken get too hot and sounds like the idea for beef where it gets tender after it get's tough. I didn't realize that people did that with poultry.

10 hours sounds "better" than 4 hours, but still a bit short for such a big piece of meat and 250ºF seems a bit "hot" for a super-slow roast. I finally found [this recipe that says 10 hours at 180ºF for a 14-16 lb turkey](https://dinnerthendessert.com/how-to-cook-a-turkey-overnight/). This recipe says, "as you slowly roast your turkey overnight at 200 degrees F for approximately 10 hours, the low temperature and moisture is basting your turkey while you sleep.  No need to baste your turkey." Which helps since the previous recipe said 10 hours but basting regularly and I wasn't sure how you were supposed to do this over night.

I plan to do the stuffing recipe from The Food Lab with the idea from the recipe to microwave the stuffing before sticking it back in the turkey again. This prevents the stuffing from slowing roast and exasterbating internal temperature differential.

The recipe on most of these turkeys is to cover the bird with butter and herbs.

The Food Lab had a reasonable sounding gravy as well so I'll try that.

Interestingly, The Food Lab at one point says to dry brine whole poultry for 24-28 hours, but in another section of the book goes on to say to NOT dry the bird for more than 24 hours or you get leathery skin. I read this after I had started dry brining the bird so we'll see.
