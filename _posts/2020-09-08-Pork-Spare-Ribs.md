WIth my recent success in BBQ and reverse sear, I decided that I'll try to cook tomorrow's pork spare ribs with a reverse sear and use my [[A-Very-Popular-BBQ-Sauce]]. It looks like the 195ºF target works for pork too. What I'm not sure about is whether to use the binchotan and hardwood smoking chips in the grill or to use the easier to control temperature of my oven for the slow cook. It's supposed to take a few hours. I worry that my grill will be too hot. When I was doing the [[BBQ-Chicken]], the grill with the top on was over 400ºF. I was hoping for something more in the range of 200ºF - 300ºF.

On the other hand, doing it in the oven and finishing the sear on the grill seems like a waste to fire up the binchotan.

But considering I have a full working day tomorrow, maybe I should use the oven...
