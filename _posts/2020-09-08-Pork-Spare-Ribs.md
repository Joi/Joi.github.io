WIth my recent success in BBQ and reverse sear, I decided that I'll try to cook tomorrow's pork spare ribs with a reverse sear and use my [[A-Very-Popular-BBQ-Sauce]]. It looks like the 195ºF target works for pork too. What I'm not sure about is whether to use the binchotan and hardwood smoking chips in the grill or to use the easier to control temperature of my oven for the slow cook. It's supposed to take a few hours. I worry that my grill will be too hot. When I was doing the [[BBQ-Chicken]], the grill with the top on was over 400ºF. I was hoping for something more in the range of 200ºF - 300ºF.

On the other hand, doing it in the oven and finishing the sear on the grill seems like a waste to fire up the binchotan.

But considering I have a full working day tomorrow, maybe I should use the oven...

I found a few recipes that are oven slow cooks.

1. [Easy, Fall-Off-The-Bone Oven Baked Ribs](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/7179/sweet-and-spicy-oven-baked-ribs/)
2. [Oven-Baked Ribs](https://cookthestory.com/oven-baked-ribs/)

The first one calls for a slow bake at 275ºF for 3-4 hours and the second one is 300ºF for 2 hours. I think I'll shoot for 250ºF for 4-5 hours. Basically, rub, bake covered for 4 hours. Check for tenderness, then blast in broiler for 3-4 per side after covering with BBQ sauce.

Made a quick BBQ rub and stuck the ribs in the oven at 1:15 PM with the oven at 225ºF and increased it to 250ºF at 1:45 PM. Unlike these roasting recipes, it seems like the timing for smoking might be better for me. Here's and interesting [chart of smoking times and temperatures](https://www.smokedbbqsource.com/smoking-times-temperatures/) which seem to be between 225ºF-250F. According to the chart, pork spare ribs need to be cooking for 5-7 hours! FOr internal temperature, it says 190-203ºF. Not sure exactly what that means. Maybe it's the target. But my theory of tenderizing is that you have to hold it in the zone.

Anyway, that's way more than the 3 hours in the recipe for 275ºF oven bake. I wonder if it has anything to do with the [[Evaporation Effect]]...
