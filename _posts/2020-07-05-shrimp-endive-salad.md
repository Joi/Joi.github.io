![Shrimp and Endive Salad](/images/shrimp-endive.jpeg)

One of my favorite restaurants in Palo Alto is [_Il Fornaio_](https://www.ilfornaio.com/). One of my favorite dishes there was their Shrimp and Endive Salad. I don't think it's on the menu anymore. I tried to recreate it by [sous vide](/recipes/Sous-Vide-Shrimp.html)'ing the shrimp and putting it on an endive salad with a vinaigrette with lemon and parsley. Mizuka did the salad. It turned out pretty close to what I remember from _Il Fornaio_!

I made croutons from left over  crust from [Gregg Mucci](https://reelbrewblog.wordpress.com/)'s excellent sourdough. The shrimp was from [Hooked Fish](https://hookedfishshop.square.site/).
