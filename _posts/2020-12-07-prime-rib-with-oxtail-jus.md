I made a prime rib in my Anova Precision Oven and it came out well.

I based the recipe off of [Anova's Prime Rib 101 recipe](https://oven.anovaculinary.com/recipe/htj4y1WPPA2sVoRlow1Y) and the Oxtail Au Jus from Kenji Lopez's The Food Lab recipe. As has been the case with other recipes from Anova that do sous vide, I found that when the probe temperature is set to the oven sous vide temperature, the temperature gets closer and closer, slower and slower, but never arrives at the exact temperature. This was the case with this prime rib as well.

The recipe calls for the sous vide to bet set at 132ºF with the probe target to be set at the same. I decided to go with 135ºF since my family tends to like things cooked closer to medium.

I dry brined the prime rib over night and then loaded it in the oven on a V rack at 7:45 AM. It cooked until 4:45 PM - 9 hours. The temperature was 132ºF when I pulled it. The roast with 5.88 lbs.

I then heated the oven to 480ºF and blasted it for about 10 min. I think I could have and maybe should have gone a bit longer. The crust wasn't as crunchy as it could have been.

I didn't use the egg coating before the searing as the recipe calls for.

I started the oxtail around 11AM. The recipe was pretty straight forward. Sear the oxtail, sauté the veggies, deglase with a bottle of red wine, add broth and herbs and simmer for 3 hours. Take the oxtail out and shred the meat to use for something else, then boil down the au jus.

The au jus was great and really added to the prime rib. The prime rib came out super juicy and tender.
