I've gotten into sharpening my knives on and off over the decades since I lived in Chicago and the sushi chef at the local sushi shop, first taught me how to handle a Japanese knife and sharpen it. I've always enjoyed sharpening knives and each time I "get into it" I seem to go a bit deeper. However, I found it hard to learn to sharpen without a good teacher and I didn't have the time, energy or the opportunity to apprentice anywhere.

As I started ramping up my cooking during COVID, I realized that my knives needed work. I pulled out my old stones and tried to sharpen my knives. One knife didn't sharpen well so I started googling. Oops.

There is a TON of information - YouTube videos, dedicated forums and blogs... all about sharpening and honing. I read a bunch of stuff, bought a few more stones and started again. I realized that my bevel was messed up so I looked up how to set a bevel.

Then I noticed reading about people obsessing about sharpening razors... Then I discovered Japanese *kamisori* razors and Japanese natural stones... then nagura stones to create slurry. This feels like a real deep end that I'm falling into where I don't yet know what I don't know - like when I started scuba diving. Oops.

So I think I'll start writing more about my [[My Whetstones]] and other sharpening and honing things on this site now.

Here are a few links I've read about stones and honing:
