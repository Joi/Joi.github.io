title: BBQ Grilled Spicy Thai-Style Skirt Steak
tags: recipe
---
I had some skirt steak left over in the freezer and wasn't so exited about cooking it - my image was dried, tough fahitas. Then, I noticed that Nosrat said it was her favorite "weekday steak" and that Kenji thought it was even more tasty than a rib eye. The problem was is that it's thin and easily turns tough.

In The Food Lab, Kenji says that if you cook it correctly, it can be really good. He says you have to sear it very quickly over a very high heat.
