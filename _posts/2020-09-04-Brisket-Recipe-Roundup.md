Lately, kind of like the way that Nosrat describes in [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/), I've started googling and reading lots of recipes around an ingredient or a dish to look for underlying patterns to get a sense of the dish first. Then I think about the diners, the ingredients that I have and what I think I have the time and energy to do. Finally, I pick a "base" recipe and modify it based on input from various other recipes to come up with the plan for the evening.

I take notes and then try to experiment and iterate to refine "my" recipe. The current note taking and knowledge management system isn't perfect for this. Currently, I have recipes and posts. Recipes are either authored or downloaded and are sort of snapshots of a recipe. Posts are delineated by date and have tags.

The recipes aren't dynamic enough - I feel like I should be taking notes and documenting stuff right in the recipes - for instance, having a master recipe for roast brisket with links to other recipes, notes from experiments and underlying sub-recipes and ideas such as [[2020-08-02-reverse-sear|Reverse Sear]].

Also, the dates on the posts are slightly problematic. Do I use the date that I did the cooking? Do I use the date that I'm writing the thing? What if a particular project, like my brisket project, take more than one day? Do I break it up into daily updates?

I actually have the same problem when I'm just note taking in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is what I'm using to author right now. Do I make a single document for a topic or do I make a document for each meeting and scatter thoughts about a topic across multiple documents and link them with hashtags and links?

So back to brisket. I'm going to start googling recipes and park them here for now... but I'm not going to cook the brisket until Sunday or Monday. But the 5 lb brisket I ordered from Savenor's is coming on Sunday. :-)

Reading some of the recipes, I realized that I need to decide whether this will be a one day affair or a two day affair. I guess doing a lot of the cooking on Sunday and finishing on Monday might work.
