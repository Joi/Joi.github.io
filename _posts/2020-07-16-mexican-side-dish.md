A\* is making Chili Con Carne with Nachos and Guacamole. I'm supposed to make the side dish. My guess is that lime, coriander and red onions are a good place to start. Maybe I'll make a salad.

And... we don't have lettuce. But we have a [Siena Farms](https://sienafarms.com/csa/peak-season-farm-share-faq/) share coming today so there might be something, but they sometimes show up right at dinner time. Maybe I'll do a Mexican cole slaw as a backup recipe since I recall seeing a bit of cabbage in the fridge.

My Mexican Coleslaw came out great. I followed [[Mexican-Coleslaw-with-Cilantro-Lime-Dressing|this Mexican Coleslaw with Cilantro Lime Dressing recipe]] and the only thing missing was bell peppers.
