I got a request for [beef stroganoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Stroganoff), but we immediately had a disagreement about what beef stroganoff is. In Japan, it has a red sauce, tastes like ketchup and demi glace sauce and is eaten over rice. In the US it is creamy, brown and served over egg pasta. I recall eating both, but we decided to try Japanese style.

First, a few demi-glace recipes and their sauce ingredients...

The recipe from [The Food Networks](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/beef-stroganoff-recipe3-1941593) calls for:

> 1/4 cup white wine
> 2 tablespoons tomato paste
> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
> 3 cups demi-glace
> 1 1/4 cups sour cream

The [Kikkoman recipe](https://www.kikkoman.com/en/cookbook/search/recipe/00000115/index.html), which should be traditionally Japanese, says:

>  tomato puree	
>  demi-glace sauce	
>  water

For more traditional creamy beef stroganoff...

[Gimme some Oven says](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/easy-beef-stroganoff-recipe/):

> 4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
> 1/2 cup dry white wine*
> 1 1/2 cups beef stock
> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
> 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt or light sour cream
> chopped fresh parsley (optional)

[Damn Delicious says](https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/08/one-pot-beef-stroganoff/):

> 2 cloves garlic, minced
> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
> 1/4 cup dry white wine
> 4 cups beef stock
> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
> 8 ounces egg noodles, uncooked
> 1/2 cup sour cream
> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

This gives me a rough idea for the recipe.

I guess I'll do:

- 2 cloves garlic
- Â¼ cup white wine
- tomato puree
- Worcestershire sauce
- flour
- cream cheese
- parsley
- demi-glace sauce

Generally, it turn out great!
