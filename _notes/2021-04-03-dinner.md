I finally got all of the sauces that are recommended in [the NHK recipe](https://www.kyounoryouri.jp/recipe/3771_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E8%B1%86%E8%85%90.html) that I saw.

It turned out well, but it seemed a bit dry.  I mixed the soy sauce and the Chinese wine with the spices. Maybe if I add them later per the recipe, it won't evaporate as much. I could also add a bit more stock.

The flavor was perfect though.
