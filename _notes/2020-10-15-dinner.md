Ever since it started getting cold, we pivoted a bit from grilling to soups. This week we had the [[Monkfish-Braised-with-White-Beans-Fennel-&-Tomato|Monkfish with Beans]], which is effectively a soup, green Thai curry with shrimp and scallops which was very soupy, tonight is [[Chicken-Bouillabaisse]] and tomorrow is beef stew.

I will use the [Zuni Cafe Cookbook](https://wwnorton.com/books/The-Zuni-Cafe-Cookbook/) tonight for the bouillabaisse and I also used the recipe for the Monkfish the day before yesterday.

I'm trying to plan when to start cooking tonight and I realized that it's hard to plan and cook on time without a kind of "run of show." Yesterday, I was making beef stock, steaming romanesco, making curry and oven frying french fries at the same time and it was really hard to keep track of where I was on everything.

I'm planning for 30 extra min because the chicken is much larger than the recipe calls for.

So here's today's run of show:
