I made my first beer battered fried fish using Nosrat's recipe. A key thing about it is to freezer chill all of the batter ingredients and bowl. There is no water, just 1 ½ cup of vodka and a bottle of beer with the batter. I think the temperature difference is supposed to make it fluffier, but I wonder how the chemistry works.

I used fluke which was a bit thin. Also, I diligently tried to keep the temperature at 365ºF per the recipe, but it seemed like it took a while to turn golden and it was a bit blotchy. I wonder if I should try increasing the temperature. I wonder if there is a good resource on the thickness of the fish, temperature and frying time.

It tasted good and went well with the tartar sauce.
