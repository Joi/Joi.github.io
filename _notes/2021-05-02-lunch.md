We ordered whole branzino from Eataly Boston. We love these - they are fresh and already stuffed with lemon, thyme and rosemary so all you have to do it sear them 3 min on each side and stick in the oven at 425ÂºF for 10 min. We love eating the tender and tastey fish with soy sauce.

We got fresh ramps and fiddlehead from Siena Farms which I grilled on the skillet while the fish was in the oven.

Yum!
