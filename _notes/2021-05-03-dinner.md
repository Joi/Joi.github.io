We had left over [Lamb Tagine](/recipes/lamb-tagine) and I made [[guacamole]] in our [[molcajete]].

The lamb was nice, but reminded me that maybe next time I can stew it a bit slower and make it more tender. I love stews though since they reheat well after freezing.

The red onion was a bit old and I misjudged the size of the mocajete so I ended up not being able to fit enough avocado so I edited the recipe to rebalnce the ingredients to fit my molcajete.
