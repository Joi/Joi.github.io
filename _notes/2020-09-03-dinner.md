As more and more of my cooking becomes elaborate, the recipes that I'm excited about increasingly involve slow cooking. I've tried to figure out ways to monitor temperature remotely and otherwise figure out how to do slow cooks during a working day, but it's been difficult.

I played with the pressure cooker a bit early on, but I decided to give it another go to see if I can compress the cooking times on some things that I would normally leave for the weekend or try to mash into a week day.

This week, I tried two dishes that I would normally have not used a pressure cooker for.

The first one was the [[Bolognese-Sauce-Recipe-Instant-Pot]] yesterday. When making Ragu/Bolognese, I traditionally used [[Ragu-Bolognese|a recipe]] from Harry's Bar Cookbook and cooked it for several hours instead of the 1 hour in the recipe. The Instant Pot recipe wasn't as good as the slow cooked Ragu, but it was quite good and much better than just quick meat sauce without the simmering - the meat was softer, the sauce creamier and the veggies very soft. I think next time, I'll try sticking the veggies in the Thermomix to see if I can get the *soffrito* to be better.

Tonight I tried making Beef Back Ribs using an [[Instant-Pot-Beef-Back-Ribs|Instant Pot recipe]]. The recipe involves blasting the ribs in the Instant Pot pressure cooker with apple cider vinegar after a few hours in the fridge with a spice rub. Then, the ribs go into the oven at high heat after basting with BBQ sauce to get a crunchy skin. Again, they didn't come out tasting like they were slow cooked - indeed they looked and tasted like pressure cooked and then seared ribs, but they were pretty good nonetheless.

I'm going to keep experimenting and I'm excited to read [Dinner in an Instant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524762962/) by Melissa Clark that Adam recommended to look for some other tips. My current thinking is that the pressure cooker is definitely better than doing these things quickly without the pressure cooker, but I still prefer the slow cooking if I have time.
