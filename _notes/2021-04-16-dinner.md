Made meuniere with flounder from Red's. The flounder was a pack of small fillets. It's a bit annoying when ordering delivery fish because it's really hard to guess how big the fish are, especially with flounder, fluke and sole.

I fried them quickly and they came out well though. I think smaller fish cook faster and maybe the oil can be a bit hotter to get the browning faster.
