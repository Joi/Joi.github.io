Ordered two prime rib from Savenor's. Lit [binchotan](/pages/binchotan) on the Weber grill. Put steaks on cool side of grill and smoked a bit with mesquite. Switched between searing and slow cooking the meat to try to avoid the flames from the oil drippings from hitting the steak or getting too big.

Towards the end, put blue cheese on the steak and then covered with a butter and chive sauce. Yum!
