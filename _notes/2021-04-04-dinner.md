I used [the serious eats recipe](/recipes/slow-roasted-boneless-leg-of-lamb-with-garlic-rosemary-and-lemon) for the rub for the lamb and allowed it to dry-brine overnight.

I tried cooking lab leg from Farmers To You using a [[_pages/reverse-sear|reverse sear]] starting in the Anova oven at 132ºF until the inner temperature was 130ºF then searing it on the grill over [[binchotan]].

One thing that I noticed was that the fat on the fat cap drips and ignites and I'm not sure how to do a good sear without getting fat smoke when it flames out.

The sear was OK, but not great because of the fire.

The lamb was chewy. In retrospect, I realize that the leg is pretty lean in most parts and it makes sense that maybe it was a bit chewy.

Reminds of the top round.

Going to use the left over lamb to try to make Lamb Tagine tomorrow.
