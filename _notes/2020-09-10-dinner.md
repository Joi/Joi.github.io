As the weather cools, it's becoming that time of year again when braises and stews taste great.

Braised chicken was one of my early favorites at the beginning of the COVID lockdown and I'm now returning to it with more experience and thoughts.

I'm starting with a 3 lb chicken from Eataly Boston which I spatchcocked and dry brined yesterday.

I think I'll cut up the pieces and oven braise it in a tomato sauce.
