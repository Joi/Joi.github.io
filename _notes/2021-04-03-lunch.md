![white pizza](/images/recipes/pizza-16.jpg)
I tried making pizza with just EVOO, salt, _parmesan_ cheese and rosemary. I stretched it to look a bit like flatbread and used 00 Caputo flour. It came out well, but it was a bit salty and it got hard after it cooled. It was probably too thin for Kio so next time I'll try with a blend of all-purpose flower.
