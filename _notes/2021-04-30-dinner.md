My sister and my brother-in-law were over from California so I cooked one of our favorites, [Monkfish Braised with White Beans, Fennel & Tomato](/recipes/monkfish-braised-with-white-beans-fennel-tomato) from the Zuni Cafe cookbook. As usual, I added a curry seasoning to make it more like the Kirkland Tap & Trotter recipe. It turned out well.

We also got sunchokes from Siena Farms so I made one of my new favorites, [Smashed Sunchokes with Thyme-Butter](/recipes/smashed-sunchokes-with-thyme-butter). Yumi!
