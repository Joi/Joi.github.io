Made lamb tagine with left over roast lamb lag. The roast lab was a bit chewy and tough so was searching for something good to do with several pounds of lamb left over.

The tagine was easy to make and it came out great. It was an Anova oven recipe but I did it in my main Wolf oven with a dutch oven.
