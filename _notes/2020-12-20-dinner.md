6.25 lb bone-in beef rib roast from Farmers To You.

Put in Anova oven at 7:55 am set to sous vide 133ÂºF. Seared after putting eggs and herbs on per Anova recipe. Pulled at 5:30 pm. Came out too tough and too rare. Also tried to leave bone on and cut along bone but that made the pieces too thick and crooked.
