![Beef strognanoff](/images/recipes/beef-stroganoff-1.jpg)

Tried making beef stroganoff, which turned out well the first time, using a small amount of the oxtail au jux left over from [[2021-02-20-dinner|a prime rib dinner]] and canned tomato sauce instead of puree. It came out tasing a bit flat. It felt like it needed something sweeter - maybe tomato paste (I added it to the recipe) or proper demi-glace. Need to try it again. I also used sirloin tips and the meat was a bit tough. I'll try something fattier like prime rib next time.
