(Didn't put BBQ sauce on the left side in case it was too spicy for Mizuka. It wasn't.)

Upgraded my [BBQ sauce](/recipes/bbq-sauce) recipe based on Steven Raichlen's recipe. Switched to real Worchestershire, added liquid smoke and added the step of simmering the sauce for 15-20 min. The sauce was MUCH better than my old recipe.

I used the Anova recipe for the ribs which is basically season, then cook at 100% steam / 164ÂºF for 8+ hours. Then coat with BBQ sauce and sear. I cooked them for 10 hours. They were REALLY good. The best ribs so far.
