Tried making beef stroganoff, which turned out well the first time, using a small amount of the oxtail au jux left over from [[2020-12-07-prime-rib-with-oxtail-jus]] and canned tomato sauce instead of puree. It came out tasing a bit flat. It felt like it needed something sweeter - maybe tomato paste (I added it to the recipe) or proper demi-glace. Need to try it again. I also used sirloin tips and the meat was a bit tough. I'll try something fattier like prime rib next time.
