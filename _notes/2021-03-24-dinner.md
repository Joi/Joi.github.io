The mapo dofu I made last time came out sort of "dry" and not really juicy and red enough. This might be Japanese mapo dofu vs Chinese. I used [a recipe from Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/ma-po-tofu-real-deal/) last time.

I'm going to look at a [the NHK recipe](https://www.kyounoryouri.jp/recipe/3771_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E8%B1%86%E8%85%90.html) to see if I can incorporate some ideas the Japanese recipe.

Started [[mapo-dofu|a recipe]] stub about this recipe.

Ended up using LKK Guizhou Style Black Bean Chili Sauce, LKK Hoisin Sauce and a Chinese chili garlic sauce rather than the sauces from recipe. They were close, but not the same as the recommended sauces. It turned out better than the last time, but still not exactly what I imagined. I ordered Lee Kum Kee Sweet Bean Sauce (tianmian sauce) and Lee Kum Kee Sweet Bean Sauce (doubanjiang) and Li Jinji Douchi (douchi sauce) for next time.
