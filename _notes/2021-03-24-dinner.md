The mapo dofu I made last time came out sort of "dry" and not really juicy and red enough. This might be Japanese mapo dofu vs Chinese. I used [a recipe from Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/ma-po-tofu-real-deal/) last time.

I'm going to look at a [the NHK recipe](https://www.kyounoryouri.jp/recipe/3771_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E8%B1%86%E8%85%90.html) to see if I can incorporate some ideas the Japanese recipe.

Started a recipe stub about this recipe.

Ended up using Guizhou Style Black Bean Chili Sauce, Hoisin Sauce and a different red chili sauce than the recipe. It turned out better than the last time, but still not exactly what I imagined. I ordered Lee Kum Kee Sweet Bean Sauce (tianmian sauce) and Lee Kum Kee Sweet Bean Sauce (doubanjiang) and Li Jinji Douchi (douchi sauce) for next time.
