directions: 'Place the frozen seafood in a large bowl. Fill the bowl with cool water.
  Allow to defrost for about 5 minutes, stirring gently to separate pieces, and replacing
  the water once during the defrosting process. Place the defrosted seafood on a clean
  kitchen towel or on paper towels to dry.


  Melt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. When foaming subsides,
  add the seafood, kosher salt, minced garlic, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Stir-fry
  just until opaque, about 5 minutes.


  Transfer the sauteed seafood to a serving platter, spooning the pan juices on top.
  Squeeze lemon juice on top of the seafood saute and garnish with chopped parsley.
  Serve immediately.'
