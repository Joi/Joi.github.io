difficulty: Easy
directions: 'To prepare the meat, heat a large skillet over a medium-high heat. Add
  the beef and cook until no longer pink, stirring occasionally and breaking the meat
  up with the spoon. Add the garlic and beans and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the
  chili powder, cayenne and water and stir until well combined and some but not all
  of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool
  slightly. Meat mixture may be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in an airtight
  container in the refrigerator.


  To make the tomato dressing, in a medium bowl, combine tomatoes (with their juices),
  oil, lime juice, salt and pepper. Dressing may be prepared up to 2 days ahead and
  stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.


  Place 2 cups of lettuce on each plate or in a lunch container. Top each serving
  with 1 cup of the beef mixture then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of cheese. If making
  to-go, pack 3/4 cup of the tomato mixture in a separate sealable container and put
  about 8 chips in a separate bag. Right before eating, pour a portion of the tomato
  mixture with the liquid on top of each salad, and crush tortilla chips on top.'
