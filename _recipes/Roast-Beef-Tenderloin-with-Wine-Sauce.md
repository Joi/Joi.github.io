directions: "FOR THE SAUCE:\n\nMelt 5 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan.\
  \ Add the shallots and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft\
  \ and translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, thyme sprigs, salt,\
  \ pepper and sugar, and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes,\
  \ or until the liquid is reduced by about half.\n\nWhile the liquid is reducing,\
  \ place the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in a small bowl and soften in the\
  \ microwave, if necessary (it should be soft but not melted). Add the flour and,\
  \ using a small spoon, mix into a smooth paste.\n\nOnce the wine mixture is reduced,\
  \ reduce the heat to low and remove the thyme sprigs. Whisk the flour-butter paste,\
  \ a teaspoonful at a time, into the simmering liquid, and simmer for a few minutes,\
  \ until the sauce is thickened. Set aside. (The sauce can be made up to this point\
  \ and refrigerated up to 3 days ahead of time.)\n\nFOR THE TENDERLOIN:\n\nLet the\
  \ beef stand at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting. Set an oven rack in\
  \ the middle position and preheat the oven to 400\xB0F.\n\nSeason the beef all over\
  \ with kosher salt and pepper. Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high\
  \ heat until almost smoking. Cook, turning with tongs, until well browned on all\
  \ but one side, about 10 minutes total. Turn the tenderloin so that the un-seared\
  \ side is down, and transfer the skillet directly to the preheated oven. (If your\
  \ pan isn't oven-proof, transfer the beef to a lightly oiled roasting pan.) Roast\
  \ until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 120\xB0F-125\xB0\
  \ for medium rare, about 15 minutes, or until done to your liking (115\xB0F-120\xB0\
  F for rare, 130\xB0F-135\xB0F for medium). Keep in mind that these temperatures\
  \ account for the fact that the temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees\
  \ while the meat rests.\n\nTransfer the meat to a carving board (preferably with\
  \ a well for collecting juices) and let it rest, covered loosely with aluminum foil,\
  \ for 10 to 15 minutes. Place a dishtowel or oven mitt over the handle of the roasting\
  \ pan to remind yourself that it's hot.\n\nMeanwhile, carefully discard the fat\
  \ from the roasting pan (remember that the handle is hot!). Set the pan on the stovetop\
  \ and add the 1/4 cup of beef broth. Bring the broth to a boil, using a wooden spoon\
  \ to scrape the fond, or brown bits, from the bottom of the pan. Add the flavorful\
  \ broth to the red wine sauce, and then bring the sauce to a simmer.\n\nCarve the\
  \ tenderloin into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Serve the beef, passing the red wine sauce\
  \ at the table."
