directions: 'In a medium bowl, toss together mint, cilantro and sprouts; set aside.


  In a small bowl, mix salt with sugar and chile flakes; set aside.


  Remove the tough outer layer of the lemongrass then smash the remaining stalk with
  the side of a chef''s knife or mallet to release the oils.


  Finely chop and set aside.

  salt mixture then sear, flipping once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.


  Move fish to one side of the skillet then add ginger and garlic and cook for 1 minute.


  Add coconut milk, soy sauce, fish sauce, chopped lemongrass, bell peppers, carrots
  and green onions and cook for 5 minutes at a fast simmer, or until the fish is just
  done and opaque throughout; stir in lime juice.


  Serve cod in bowls, ladling the broth and vegetables over the top.


  Garnish with reserved sprout mixture and lime wedges.'
