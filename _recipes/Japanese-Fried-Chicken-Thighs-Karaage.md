directions: 'Combine soy sauce, sake, ginger, garlic, sugar, and salt in medium bowl.
  Add chicken and toss to combine. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. While
  chicken is marinating, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Set wire rack
  in second rimmed baking sheet and line rack with triple layer of paper towels. Place
  cornstarch in wide bowl.


  Lift chicken from marinade, 1 piece at a time, allowing excess marinade to drip
  back into bowl but leaving any garlic or ginger bits on chicken. Coat chicken with
  cornstarch, shake off excess, and place on parchment-lined sheet.


  Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 325 degrees. While oil heats,
  check chicken pieces for white patches of dry cornstarch. Dip back of spoon in reserved
  marinade and gently press onto dry spots to lightly moisten.


  Using tongs, add half of chicken, 1 piece at a time, to oil in single layer. Cook,
  adjusting burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 300 and 325
  degrees, until chicken is golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Using spider
  skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer chicken to paper towel-lined rack. Return oil
  to 325 degrees and repeat with remaining chicken. Serve with lemon wedges.'
