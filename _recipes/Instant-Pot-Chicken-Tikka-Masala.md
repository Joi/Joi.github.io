What is an Instant Pot: An Instant Pot is a multi-cooker, it’s like seven different appliances all in one! It does the job of a slow cooker, pressure cooker, rice cooker, steamer, yogurt maker, etc. I strongly recommend reading the manufacturer’s guide for instructions on how to use your Instant Pot before attempting this recipe.

Note: The Instant Pot will default to 30 minutes when set on Poultry, use the down arrow to change to 5 minutes.

Half and half can be found near the milk and cream in the dairy section of your local grocery store. Half and half is a blend of equal parts whole milk and light cream. It averages 10 to 12% of fat.

Chicken: I used both skinless boneless chicken thighs and breasts, so both can be used with the same cooking time.

Storage: You can store this chicken tikka masala recipe in the fridge for up to 4 days in an airtight container. It freezes well as well, for up to 3 months. Be sure to thaw it completely before reheating on the stove.
