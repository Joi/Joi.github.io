directions: 'Coarsely chop the anchovies and then pound them into a fine paste in
  a mortar and pestle. The more you break them down, the better the dressing will
  be.


  In a medium bowl, stir together the anchovies, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice,
  vinegar, Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper. Taste with a leaf of lettuce,
  then add salt and adjust acid as needed. Or, practicing what you learned about Layering
  Salt , add a little bit of each salty ingredient to the mayonnaise, bit by bit.
  Adjust the acid, then taste and adjust the salty ingredients until you reach the
  ideal balance of Salt, Fat, and Acid. Has putting a lesson you read in a book into
  practice ever been this delicious? I doubt it.


  To make the salad, use your hands to toss the greens and Torn Croutons with an abundant
  amount of dressing in a large bowl to coat evenly. Garnish with Parmesan and freshly
  ground black pepper and serve immediately.


  Refrigerate leftover dressing, covered, for up to 3 days.


  Ideal for romaine and Little Gem lettuce, chicories, raw or blanched Kale, shaved
  Brussels sprouts, Belgian endive.'
