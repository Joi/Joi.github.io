directions: "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nWe halve the chicken breasts crosswise for even cooking.\
  \ Use Brussels sprouts no bigger than golf balls, as larger ones are often tough\
  \ and woody.\n\nAdjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.\
  \ Toss fennel, potatoes, shallots, parsnips, garlic, 2 teaspoons thyme, oil, 1 teaspoon\
  \ rosemary, sugar, \xBE teaspoon salt, and \xBC teaspoon pepper together in bowl.\
  \ Combine butter, remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary, \xBC\
  \ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in second bowl; set aside.\n\nPat chicken\
  \ dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place vegetables in single\
  \ layer on rimmed baking sheet, arranging fennel in center. Place chicken, skin\
  \ side up, on top of vegetables, arranging breast pieces in center and leg and thigh\
  \ pieces around perimeter of sheet.\n\nBrush chicken with herb butter and roast\
  \ until breasts register 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs -register 175 degrees,\
  \ 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pan halfway through cooking. Transfer chicken to serving\
  \ platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Toss\
