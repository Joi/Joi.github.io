directions: 'Place the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and
  garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to combine.


  Add the shrimp to the bag and seal. Toss to coat evenly with the marinade.


  Marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. You don''t want to marinate for
  longer than that, as the acid in the lemon juice will start to cook the shrimp.


  Thread the shrimp onto skewers. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium high heat.


  Place the skewers on the grill. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until shrimp
  are pink and opaque.


  Broiler directions: Preheat the broiler. Place the shrimp skewers on a sheet pan
  coated with cooking spray. Broil for 2-3 minutes on each side or until shrimp are
  pink and opaque.


  Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.'
