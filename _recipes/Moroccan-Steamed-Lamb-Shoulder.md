directions: 'Season the lamb: Mix the salt with cumin and coriander, then rub mixture
  over surface of meat. Cover and leave at room temperature for 1 hour (or cover and
  refrigerate several hours or overnight, then bring to room temperature).


  Set up a steamer with abundant boiling water and steamer basket above water level.
  Put lamb in steamer, cover tightly and steam over medium-high heat until lamb is
  quite tender and nearly falling apart, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (Alternatively, steam lamb
  in a pressure cooker for about 11/2 hours.)


  Make the saffron butter: Put a teaspoon of water in a small bowl and add crumbled
  saffron threads. When saffron has released its color, add butter, cumin and salt,
  then mash together with a small spoon. Leave at room temperature.


  Make the red pepper oil: Whirl chopped pepper, garlic, cayenne, cumin and olive
  oil in a food processor or blender. Transfer to a serving bowl and season with salt.


  When lamb is almost done, add carrots, turnips and zucchini to steamer and cook
  until softened, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, cook vegetables in separate steamer
  or simmer in lightly salted water.)


  Put lamb on a large serving platter, cut into rough chunks and surround with vegetables.
  Smear surface of lamb with saffron butter. Ladle a bit of lamb broth from bottom
  of steamer over vegetables (save remaining broth for another purpose). Garnish with
  cilantro sprigs. Serve red pepper sauce alongside.'
