<div class="box box-notes"><p>Chef Robert Harris suggested that the aromatics shouldn't be added until about 1 ½ hours before you're done since they don't improve with super-long heating.</p>

Remember - <strong>NO SALT</strong>. Save the salt for whatever cooking you will use the stock in.</p>
<p>Put spices in a bouquet garni bag to if you want to keep things tidy.</p>
<p>Add water and bring to a boil over high heat and then turn down to a simmer. Skim the foam and add the vinegar.</p>
<p>Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours. Never boil or allow to &quot;roll&quot; if you want to stock to stay clear.</p>
<p>Strain and cool.</p>
<p>Scrape fat and freeze to use for other cooking stuff like confit.</p>
<p>Refrigerate stock for up to 5 days and freezer for much longer. I use quart ziplock bags. Also cool to use in ice cube tray to make smaller portions for sauces.</p>
