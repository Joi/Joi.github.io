directions: '2. Remove outer leaves


  Use a pairing knife to remove the outer leaves from the base of the cauliflower.


  3. Remove core


  Use the tip of a pairing knife to remove the inner core. This is the thickest part
  of the cauliflower and would still be undercooked by the time the rest of the head
  is tender.


  4. Coat with olive oill


  Coat with olive oil on all sides, including the underside.


  6. Prepare sheet pans


  Line a solid sheet pan with foil to catch oil drippings. Place the cauliflower on
  the perforated sheet pan so steam can circulate freely.


  7. Steam Cook


  Using steam in conjunction with high heat will speed up cooking and keep the cauliflower
  from drying out.


  9. Vent steam


  As soon as you start the browning stage, open the oven door for a few seconds to
  vent out residual steam.


  10. Slice and serve


  Cut into the cauliflower like you''re cutting a cake, or slice across the whole
  head to serve roasted cauliflower "steaks."'
