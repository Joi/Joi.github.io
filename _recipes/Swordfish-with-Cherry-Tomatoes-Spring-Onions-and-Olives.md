directions: 'Cut an X on the bottom of the cherry tomatoes, blanch them for less than
  1 minute, drain them, peel them and cut them into pieces. Place the tomato pieces
  in a bowl and season them with 1/2 cup of oil, a pinch of salt, a sprig of thyme,
  1 unpeeled clove garlic and 1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns. Let the tomatoes marinate
  for 15 minutes.


  Clean and pare the spring onions, removing part of the green parts. Cut them into
  chunks, stew them in a covered pan with a little oil, 1 unpeeled garlic clove and
  a sprig of marjoram for 4-5 minutes, then add the olives, cut into halves, and 1
  ladle of water and continue cooking for 5 minutes more, then remove from heat.


  Cook the swordfish in a pan with a little oil and a sprig of thyme on the lowest
  possible heat, for 6 minutes per side. Slice the swordfish and serve it with the
  spring onions and marinated tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt to taste and a few marjoram
  leaves and serve.'
