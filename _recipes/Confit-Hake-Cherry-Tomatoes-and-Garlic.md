directions: 'Heat the oven to 170C/fan 150C/gas 3. Put the tomatoes, fennel, peppers,
  whole garlic, peppercorns, coriander seeds and sage into a deep roasting tin or
  large shallow casserole dish, then pour over enough oil to completely submerge everything.
  Cover tightly with foil or put on a lid. Cook in the oven for 45 minutes or until
  the vegetables are beginning to soften. Meanwhile, season the hake fillets and put
  in the fridge.


  Turn the oven down to 150C/fan 130C/ gas 2. Remove the dish from the oven and gently
  lower the hake into it (be careful, as the oil will be hot), ensuring the fish is
  fully submerged. Put back into the oven for 20 minutes or until just cooked through.


  Lift out the fish and vegetables with a slotted spoon, and divide between 4 plates,
  alongside a green salad and plenty of bread for mopping up juices.'
