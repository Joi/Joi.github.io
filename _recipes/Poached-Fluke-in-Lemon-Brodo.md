directions: 'Finely zest the lemons using a rasp-style grater. Cut the top and bottom
  ends off the lemons, then stand each on a cut end and slice off the remaining peel
  to expose the flesh. (Try to remove all of the bitter white pith.) Working over
  a bowl, cut the lemon segments from the membranes, then cut each segment in half.
  Squeeze the membranes into a small bowl, and reserve the juice.


  Heat a large, straight-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the butter, oil, onion,
  and 1/2 tsp. salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion just starts to soften,
  2 to 3 minutes. Add the lemon zest, segments, and juice. Reduce the heat to low
  and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is very tender and the lemons are
  breaking down, 5 to 8 minutes. Raise the heat to medium high and add the fish stock,
  thyme, and bay leaf; reduce the heat to low, and simmer until fragrant, 20 to 30
  minutes.


  Season the fish with salt and pepper. Gently slide the fish into the poaching broth
  and cook over medium-low heat at a very gentle simmer, occasionally basting the
  top of the fish with the liquid, until cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Discard the
  thyme and bay leaf.


  Using a fish spatula, divide the fish among four shallow bowls and evenly distribute
  the broth around the fish. Garnish each bowl with the chives and a drizzle of oil.'
