directions: "**The Rice**\n\nBring the stock to a simmer.\n\nHeat the olive oil in\
  \ a heavy, large saucepan. Add onion and cook until golden but not brown. Add the\
  \ rice and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the rice. Turn the heat to high and\
  \ add some of the hot broth. The recipes say to add the broth gradually, but according\
  \ to Kenji in Food lab, you can add it all at once. The downside is that you might\
  \ have too much at the end. I don't add it all at once, but I add a bunch at the\
  \ beginning.\n\nYou will need to stir constantly until liquid is absorbed. Continue\
  \ adding broth, stirring until each batch is absorbed. This will take at least 20\
  \ minutes. (Half way through this process you will add the vegetable mixture, below)\
  \ You may have to adjust the heat from time to time but the risotto needs to keep\
  \ boiling, but must not stick to the pot. The rice, when done, should be tender\
  \ but with still the slightest bit of firmness. When all liquid is absorbed, remove\
  \ from heat and stir in butter and Parmesan. Mix well until creamy. Add salt and\
  \ pepper to taste. Serve with Parmesan for sprinkling. \n\n**Vegetables**\n\nHeat\
  \ oil in pot. Add the garlic to flavor the oil. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5\
  \ minutes until softened. Add the basil and oregano. Add the onion and cook for\
  \ 2 minutes. Add the zucchini, broccoli, bell pepper, tomatoes and leek. Raise head\
  \ and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, until veggies are just cooked. Season\
  \ with salt and pepper."
