directions: 'Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl or heat-proof glass measuring cup
  and pour on 2 cups boiling water. Let sit 15 to 30 minutes, until mushrooms are
  softened. Drain through a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a paper towel and set
  over a bowl. Rinse the mushrooms in several changes of water, squeeze out excess
  water and chop coarsely. Set aside. Measure out 1 cup of the soaking liquid and
  set aside.


  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy nonstick
  skillet. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brown, in batches, for 5 minutes
  on each side. Transfer the chicken pieces to a bowl as they are done. Pour the fat
  off from the pan and discard.


  Turn the heat down to medium, add the remaining oil and the onion, carrot and celery,
  as well as a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften,
  about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes and salt to
  taste. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, until
  the mixture is soft and aromatic. Stir in the fresh and dried mushrooms, turn the
  heat back up to medium, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are just tender,
  about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the wine and bring to a boil.
  Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the wine has reduced by about half. Add
  the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes,
  stirring often, until the tomatoes have cooked down a little and smell fragrant.
  Stir in the mushroom soaking liquid that you set aside.


  Return the chicken pieces to the pan and stir so that they are well submerged in
  the tomato mixture. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes, until the
  chicken is tender. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve with pasta or rice.'
