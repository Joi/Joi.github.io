directions: 'In a Dutch oven or high-sided frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive
  oil and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Brown the ribs on
  all sides, then remove, and discard the fat.


  Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pan and brown 1 onion and 2 garlic cloves.
  Deglaze the pan with the water, add back the ribs, cover, and put into a 400 degree
  oven for 1 hour. Remove the pan, turn over the ribs, and put back in the oven for
  another hour.


  Check the ribs. The meat should be tender and almost falling off the bone. If you''re
  using short ribs, you may need to increase the cooking time another hour and you
  may have to add another cup of liquid.


  Put the ribs into one container. Strain out the onions and garlic and discard. Put
  the braising liquid into a second container and refrigerate.


  The next day, peel the thick layer of fat off the braising liquid and discard. In
  the same pan you used the day before, heat the olive oil and butter. Brown the potatoes,
  mushrooms, and the rest of the onions, add the ribs and the braising liquid. Cover
  and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, broccoli, parsley, the rest
  of the garlic, and Brussels sprouts. Cover and simmer another 15 minutes.


  Serve the ribs in bowls with plenty of vegetables, the braising liquid, and a fresh
  baguette.'
