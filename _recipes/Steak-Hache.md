directions: 'Soak the mushrooms in enough boiling water to cover them for 20 minutes,
  then drain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, and finely chop. (Reserve
  the liquid if you want to add mushroomy savor to a future soup or pasta sauce. It
  freezes well as a few ice cubes.)


  In a medium bowl, mix the beef, 6 tablespoons of the mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of
  the butter, 1 tablespoon of the onion, the egg, a large pinch of salt and the Parmesan
  until well combined. Form into 4 1-inch thick patties.


  Make porcini butter by combining the remaining mushrooms and 4 tablespoons of butter
  and a sprinkle of salt. Make salsa verde by soaking the remaining onion in the vinegar
  with a sprinkle of salt for 10 minutes, then adding the capers, parsley and olive
  oil to cover and make it a bit swimmy; taste for salt, and adjust.


  Heat a heavy cast-iron pan, and drizzle with olive oil. Cook the chopped steaks
  for 4 minutes on the first side, salting them liberally. Flip, and cook for 4 minutes
  on the second side, salting again. (Cook longer for medium.) Remove the steaks to
  a waiting hot plate. Top immediately with the porcini butter. Let rest a few moments,
  then spoon salsa verde over each, and serve.'
