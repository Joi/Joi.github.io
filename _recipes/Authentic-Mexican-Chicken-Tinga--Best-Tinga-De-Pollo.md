directions: 'Bring a pot of salty water to a boil and add the chicken breast to cook.
  Let the chicken simmer until is cooked through.


  Make sure you skim the foam that forms on top of the water as it starts boiling.


  While the chicken is cooking, place the tomatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with
  water, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or
  until the tomatoes are soft and mushy but not falling apart.


  Slice the onions thinly. Heat the oil in a large pan(skillet) and add the onion.
  Cook the onion until soft and translucent for about 5-6 minutes.


  In a blender, throw the tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper and 2-3 chipotle chiles from
  the can. Be careful with the chiles. The original Mexican recipe calls for the entire
  can of Chipotle, but I found it to be too powerful and spicy for us, so I added
  fewer chiles in the blender.


  After blending the ingredients, taste the salsa for salt and pepper and adjust the
  amount of salt and pepper.


  Pour the salsa over onions. Add oregano, marjoram, thyme and pepper.(Be careful
  as the sauce will steam and bubble).


  Simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until the sauce deepens in color, becomes
  darker and less soupy, about 7-8 minutes.


  Take the chicken out of the broth and with two forks, shred the meat.


  Add it to the sauce and mix well to incorporate the chicken.


  Let it simmer for only a minute and serve over rice or on warm tortillas.


  Bon Appetite!'
