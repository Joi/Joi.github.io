directions: "1. Combine cumin, coriander, chili powder, oregano, 2 teaspoons salt,\
  \ and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Rub aggressively into steak so that\
  \ it is worked into all cracks and crevices.\n\n2. Heat half of the oilin a large\
  \ stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add steak\
  \ and cook, turning frequently, until an instant-read thermometer registers 120\
  \ to 125\xB0F for medium-rare, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat as necessary if steak\
  \ smokes excessively or starts to burn. Transfer to a large plate to rest. Repeat\
  \ with the remaining oil and steak and then add to the plate. Proceed to step 4.\n\
  \n3. Alternatively, to finish on a grill: Light one chimney full of charcoal. When\
  \ all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals\
  \ on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and\
  \ allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill\
  \ to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil\
  \ the grilling grate. Place steak directly on hot side of grill and cook, turning\
  \ frequently, until well browned and an instant read thermometer inserted into the\
  \ center registers 125\xB0F for medium, 3 to 8 minutes total depending on thickness.\
  \ Transfer steak to a cutting board and set aside.\n\n4. Reduce heat to medium and\
  \ add the corn. Cook without moving until well-charred, about 3 minutes. Stir, scraping\
  \ up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet and keep cooking until well-charred\
  \ on several sides, about 6 minutes total. Add the jalape\xF1o, onion, and garlic\
  \ and cook until softened, about 1 minute longer. Add lime juice and scrape any\
  \ browned bits off bottom of pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper and reduce\
  \ heat to low.\n\n5. Spread the tortillas out over the mixture, overlapping as needed.\
  \ Cover and cook until tortillas are softened and warm, about 1 minute. Meanwhile,\
  \ slice steak thinly against the grain. Place tortillas on serving plates and top\
  \ with the corn mixture. Top with steak, a dollop of yogurt, and a drizzle of sriracha\
  \ as desired. Sprinkle with mint and serve immediately with lime wedges."
