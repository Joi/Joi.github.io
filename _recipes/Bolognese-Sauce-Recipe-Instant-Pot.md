For the best flavor and texture of this sauce, crushed San Marzano tomatoes are key. Other crushed tomato varieties, or those packed in a more watery juice instead of pur√©e, will yield a thinner, less flavorful sauce.

Make ahead: Bolognese sauce can be stored in airtight containers for 3-4 days in the refrigerator, or 3-4 months in the freezer.
