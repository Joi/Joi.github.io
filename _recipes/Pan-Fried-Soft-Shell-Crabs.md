directions: "Instructions Checklist\n\nWhisk flour, salt, and pepper; place on a dinner\
  \ plate. Dredge 2 soft-shell crabs in flour mixture, shaking off excess (make sure\
  \ crabs are completely coated).\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saut\xE9 pan\
  \ over medium-high heat. The oil should be very hot but not smoking. Place flour-coated\
  \ crabs, back side down, in saut\xE9 pan; reduce heat to medium if pan starts to\
  \ smoke. Saut\xE9 crabs until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes (do not stand too\
  \ close to pan; crabs tend to spatter during cooking). Turn crabs over, and cook\
  \ 2 minutes more.\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon butter and a large pinch of parsley to skillet.\
  \ Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over crabs. Keep warm in a low oven. Repeat\
  \ process until all the crabs are cooked."
