description: "THIS IS AN EASY, CROWD-PLEASING DISH I OWE TO MADELEINE SERRAILLE, SISTER\
  \ of the famous fr\xE8res Troisgros. It is one of the distracting dishes her brother\
  \ Jean would sniff and sample when he happened by her house on his way back to the\
  \ restaurant to cook salmon in sorrel sauce and steak \xE0 la moelle. Madeleine\
  \ claimed it was from Ali-Bab\u2019s Gastronomie Pratique, an idiosyncratic elevenpound\
  \ treasury of French cooking that she insisted I buy and study the summer before\
  \ I went to college.\n\nA\xEFoli gives this dish richness along with a jolt of garlic;\
  \ a lighter alternative is to rub the hot toasted bread with raw garlic.\n"
difficulty: ''
directions: "Seasoning the chicken (for the best flavor and succulence, do this step\
  \ 12 to 24 hours in advance):\n\nTrim the excess fat, then season the chicken evenly\
  \ all over with salt {we use 3/4 teaspoon sea salt per pound of chicken}. Cover\
  \ loosely and refrigerate. Combine the onions with the oil and a few pinches of\
  \ salt in a 4-quart saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently\
  \ so they do not color, until the onions are nutty-tender and translucent and have\
  \ fallen to half their former mass, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the bay leaf, thyme,\
  \ and chili, breaking the pod in half if you want the bouillabaisse to be a little\
  \ spicier. Add the white wine and boil for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, saffron,\
  \ garlic, and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the 4 or 2 chicken legs and\
  \ bring back to a simmer. Skim any foam.\n\nAdjust the heat to maintain a quiet\
  \ simmer and cook uncovered for about 1 hour, stirring once or twice. If using a\
  \ cut-up chicken, add the breasts after about 30 minutes of cooking time. The chicken\
  \ should be quite tender, but not falling off the bone.\n\nMeanwhile, grill or toast\
  \ the bread. Spread each warm slice with about 1 tablespoon of A\xEFoli, if using,\
  \ and place in a warm bowl.\n\nLightly skim the surface of the bouillabaisse, then\
  \ raise the heat and boil vigorously for 1 minute. Place a piece of chicken on each\
  \ toast and moisten with the golden, oniony broth. Offer the remaining a\xEFoli\
  \ as a garnish. "
