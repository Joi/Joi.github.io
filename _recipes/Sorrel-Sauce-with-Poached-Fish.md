Chefâ€™s Notes from High Ground Organics site: *The vermouth adds depth and some sweetness to the sauce. Cheap vermouth can be harsh or bitter, and the herbs and spices in them just are not very pleasant when reduced. I opted for Noilly Prat because it is a French product in a French dish, but any good quality white vermouth will work. **Dashi-kombu is a seaweed found in Japanese markets and health food stores. Kombu adds an oceanic quality missing if you do not have fish fumet. It also helps to add viscosity to the sauce. ***White pepper will blend into the sauce better, and has a slightly higher pitched flavor/aroma than black pepper, so it is called for here.
