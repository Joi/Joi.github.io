directions: "Brown Short Ribs in Instant Pot: Heat up Instant Pot using Saut\xE9 More.\
  \ Wait until it says HOT (prevents short ribs from sticking to the pot). Add 1 tbsp\
  \ (15ml) olive oil in Instant Pot. Season one side generously with salt and black\
  \ pepper. Add in 5 pieces of short ribs, then brown each side for 4 minutes. While\
  \ one side is browning, season the other side with more salt and black pepper.\n\
  \n*Pro Tip: Avoid overcrowding by browning short ribs in batches.\n\nSaut\xE9 Onion\

  \ Instant Pot: Pour \xBD cup (125ml) red wine in Instant Pot and deglaze by scrubbing\
  \ the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Give it\
  \ a quick mix. Let the wine simmer for a minute to allow some of the alcohol to\
  \ evaporate.\n\nPressure Cook Short Ribs: Add 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, 1\
  \ tbsp (15ml) fish sauce, 1-1.5 tbsp (14-21g) brown sugar, 2 tbsp (30ml) balsamic\
  \ vinegar, and \xBD cup (125ml) unsalted chicken stock in Instant Pot. Carefully\
  \ add in browned short ribs + meat juice.\n\nIf you are making mashed potatoes:\

  \ the short ribs. Mix 2.5 tbsp (22.5g) cornstarch and 3 tbsp (45ml) cold water together\
  \ in a small mixing bowl. Bring the sauce to a simmer and add the cornstarch mixture\
  \ one third at a time to thicken the red wine sauce until desired thickness. Taste\
  \ and season with more salt, black pepper, and brown sugar if necessary (For reference:\
  \ we added 3 large pinches of salt).\n\nServe Short Ribs: Carefully place the short\
  \ ribs back in the sauce to keep them hot. Serve & be prepared for your guests to\
