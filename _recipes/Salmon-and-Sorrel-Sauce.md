directions: 'Method


  Method -- Have Ready:


  For the salmon: Cut a piece from the thickest part of the whole salmon or choose
  very thick fillets. Either buy it skinless or skin the fish yourself. Make sure
  all the bones are removed from the fillet.


  Divide the fish into 4 pieces each weighing about 6 ounces.


  Put the fish fillets between two sheets of lightly oiled wax paper and flatten the
  fish using a mallet. The purpose of this is not so much to reduce the thickeness
  as the fish as to make the fillet the same thickness throughout so the fish will
  cook the same throughout.


  Remove the stems from the sorrel but stripping the central veins from each piece.


  Preparing the Sauce:


  Put the fish stock, white wine, nouilly prat, shallots, into a sauce pan and cook
  over high heat till a near glaze is reached. Add the creme fraiche and reduce till
  the sauce is slightly thickened. Add the sorrel for around 20 seconds while stirring.
  Then incorporate the butter off the heat Before serving add a few drops of lemon
  juice


  To cook the salmon:


  Heat a "nonstick pan" without oil. Add the salmon with the seasoned side down for
  25 seconds. then turn to the second side for another 25 seconds.. The salmon should
  be undercooked since it will continue to cook after plating.


  Add the sorrel sauce to each plate then add a salmon fillet to a warmed plate. It
  is important that the plate is properly warmed first. These dishes must be served
  immediately.'
