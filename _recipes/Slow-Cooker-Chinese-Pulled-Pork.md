directions: 'Season the pork with 5-spice powder: Rub the 5 spice powder into the
  pork chunks, all over, and let sit while you prepare the sauce in the next step.


  Whisk together the sauce ingredients: Whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce,
  honey, sherry, ginger, and garlic in a medium bowl.


  Place pork and sauce in slow cooker: Place the seasoned pork shoulder pieces in
  a slow cooker, cover with the sauce.


  Slow cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low, until the meat easily pulls apart.
  About halfway through the cooking, turn the meat over in the pot.


  Ladle off excess fat: Use a ladle or a large metal spoon to remove excess fat that
  has risen to the surface while the meat has been cooking. Don''t discard it yet,
  you may want to add some of it back.


  Shred the pork: Use two forks to pull apart the pork into shreds. If the pork still
  seems dry, add back some of the fat.


  Serve over sweet Hawaiian dinner buns topped with sliced green onion or cilantro.'
