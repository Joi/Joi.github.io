description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nWe wanted to combine the ease of cream biscuits\
  \ (which eliminate the step of cutting cold fat into dry ingredients) with the ease\
  \ of drop biscuits (which skip the rolling and cutting) to create the easiest biscuits\
  \ ever. But the most obvious solution\u2014increasing the amount of cream in a cream\
  \ biscuit recipe until the dough had a droppable consistency\u2014produced biscuits\
  \ that spread too much and were greasy. Instead of increasing the amount of cream,\
  \ we found a way to increase its fluidity: We heated it to between 95 and 100 degrees,\
  \ which melted the solid particles of butterfat dispersed throughout. This made\
  \ a dough that was moister and scoopable but that rose up instead of spreading out\
  \ in the oven, producing biscuits that were appropriately rich and tender but not\
  \ greasy."
difficulty: ''
directions: "Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.\
  \ Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In medium bowl, whisk together\
  \ flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Microwave cream until just\
  \ warmed to body temperature (95 to 100 degrees), 60 to 90 seconds, stirring halfway\
  \ through microwaving. Stir cream into flour mixture until soft, uniform dough forms.\n\
  \nSpray \u2153-cup dry measuring cup with vegetable oil spray. Drop level scoops\
  \ of batter 2 inches apart on prepared sheet (biscuits should measure about 2\xBD\
  \ inches wide and 1\xBC inches tall). Respray measuring cup after every 3 or 4 scoops.\
  \ If portions are misshapen, use your fingertips to gently reshape dough into level\
  \ cylinders. Bake until tops are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating\
  \ sheet halfway through baking. Brush hot biscuits with melted butter, if using.\
  \ Serve warm. (Biscuits can be stored in zipper-lock bag at room temperature for\
  \ up to 24 hours. Reheat biscuits in 300-degree oven for 10 minutes.)"
