directions: 'In a large mixing bowl stir together bread crumbs and milk while adding
  more milk 1 Tbsp at a time to moisten bread fully. Let rest while you prep ingredients
  (or at least 5 minutes).


  To breadcrumb mixture add beef, pork, eggs, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, oregano,
  parmesan and season over top of ingredients evenly with salt and pepper (I only
  use 3/4 tsp salt if I plan on using jar sauce to coat since it can be salty).


  Gently toss mixture and break meat up with fingertips until ingredients are evenly
  mixed.


  Shape mixture with greased hands into even size meatballs, about 1 1/4-inches each
  (or about 38g).


  Oven Baked Method


  Preheat oven to 400 degrees before you begin preparing meatballs.


  Spray two dark coated non-stick pans well with non-stick cooking spray (see note
  4), or brush with olive oil.


  Place formed meatballs on baking sheets, fitting about 20 per each and spacing evenly
  apart. Bake in upper and lower third of oven 10 minutes.


  Remove and turn meatballs if browned already on bottom (use a thin metal spatula
  to scrape from baking sheet). Transfer pans to opposite racks and bake until cooked
  through, about 8 - 12 minutes longer (should register 165 degrees in center of meatballs).


  Stir into warmed marinara sauce. Simmer on low heat if desired for even more tender
  meatballs (about 10 - 20 minutes, toss occasionally gently).


  Pan Fried Stovetop Method


  To pan fry meatballs pour 3/4 cup olive oil into a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat
  over medium heat.


  Cook meatballs in 3 batches (so they aren''t overcrowded) until golden brown on
  bottom, about 4 - 6 minutes. Then turn to opposite side and cook opposite side until
  golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain.


  Transfer meatballs to warmed marinara sauce (see note 5) in a large pot, submerge
  in sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat until meatballs are 165 degrees in center,
  gently tossing meatballs occasionally, about 15 - 20 minutes.'
