*To make fresh bread crumbs tear slices of stale hearty bread into pieces and place in a food processor, pulse mixture to fine crumbs.

**You can also use 2/3 lb ground veal, 2/3 lb ground beef, 2/3 lb ground pork.

***Be sure to chop yellow onion to a fine mince, about the size of the minced garlic otherwise it won't be tender by the time meatballs are done cooking.

****Standard light aluminum baking sheets will work too meatballs just won't brown as much.
