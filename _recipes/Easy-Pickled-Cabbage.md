directions: 'Remove any brown or wilted leaves on the outside of the cabbage. Cut
  the cabbage head into 6 pieces and remove the thick stems at the core. In a large
  bowl (or a container) place the cabbage pieces, making sure they fit snugly.


  In a medium bowl prep the brine by adding the pre-boiled and cooled water, salt,
  sugar, 70% vinegar, oil, bay leaves, peppercorns. Mix all the spices well.


  Chop up (or crush) garlic cloves and distribute them among the cabbage pieces evenly.
  Pour the ready brine mixture over the cabbage pieces.


  Cover the cabbages (not the container) with a lid or a big enough plate. It should
  be just big enough to cover the cabbages and keep them under press when something
  put on top. Now, find something which can be used as a pressing tool and can be
  placed on top of the lid. I used my 10-lb dumbbell, which was perfect.


  Keep the cabbages under press, at room temperature for 3 days. When the time is
  up, open up the press and taste the awesomeness! At this time your cabbage is ready
  for consumption. Once ready, keep the pickled cabbages refrigerated.


  Viola! Enjoy and let me know how yours turned out :)


  NOTE: 70% vinegar essence can be found in many Russian, European or international
  stores. Be very careful with it though. The usual white vinegar we have in U.S.
  stores are only 6% in acidity. If ingested 70% vinegar essence can be deadly. If
  you buy some for the kitchen use, please make absolute sure that it is out of reach
  for everyone in your household.
