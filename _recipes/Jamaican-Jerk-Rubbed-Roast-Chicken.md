description: "Jerk-style chicken is a specialty of Jamaica, where the chicken gets\
  \ a wonderful smoky-sweet flavor from being slow-cooked over fresh pimento wood\
  \ or laurel wood\u2014 the tree that bay leaves come from. We don\u2019t have access\
  \ to those ingredients in our kitchens, but we do have what it takes to make the\
  \ spicy allspice-scented marinade. Rather than roast the bird over laurel wood,\
  \ I do the next best thing: roast it surrounded on all sides by thyme and bay leaves.\
  \ Using the butterflied method gets you gorgeously crisp, charred skin."
