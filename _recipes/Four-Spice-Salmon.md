directions: 'Season fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. If necessary, combine
  spices and grind them to a coarse powder in a coffee or spice grinder. Press some
  of the mixture onto the top of each fillet.


  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the
  oil or butter and, when it shimmers, place the fillets, coated side down, in the
  pan. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes, or until the spice mixture forms a nicely browned
  crust.


  Turn the fillets and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the salmon just slightly
  resists when pierced with a thin-bladed knife.'
