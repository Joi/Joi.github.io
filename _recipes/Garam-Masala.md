½ teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
½ teaspoon caraway seeds (optional)
2 dried bay leaves
1-3 dried red chiles, more to taste ( or sub 1 teaspoon chili flakes)BOTH OPTIONAL
2 inch piece cinnamon stick

Lightly toast over medium heat in a dry skillet, until crackling and fragrant, stirring often, being careful not to scorch. Grind in a Spice grinder or blender until ground into a fine powder. Store in a sealable jar.
