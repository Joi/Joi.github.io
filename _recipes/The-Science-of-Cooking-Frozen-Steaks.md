directions: "Experiment\n\nWe cut a strip loin into eight steaks, cut each steak in\
  \ half crosswise, put the pieces in vacuum-sealed bags, and froze them. We then\
  \ thawed half of each steak in the refrigerator overnight and kept the other half\
  \ frozen. Using our preferred method, we seared both sets of steaks in a hot skillet\
  \ for 90 seconds per side and then transferred them to a 275-degree oven until they\
  \ reached 125 degrees, or medium-rare, on an instant-read thermometer. To track\
  \ moisture loss, we weighed each steak before and after cooking.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\
  Not surprisingly, the frozen steaks took longer to finish cooking through in the\
  \ oven (18 to 22 minutes versus 10 to 15 minutes for the thawed steaks). What was\
  \ surprising was that the frozen steaks actually browned in the skillet just as\
  \ well as, and in the same amount of time as, the thawed steaks. Furthermore, they\
  \ had thinner bands of gray, overcooked meat directly under the crust than the thawed\
  \ steaks had. We also found that these steaks lost on average 9 percent less moisture\
  \ during cooking than the thawed steaks did. Sampling the steaks side by side, tasters\
  \ unanimously preferred the cooked-from-frozen steaks to their thawed counterparts.\n\
  \nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhile we prefer to start with steak that\u2019s never been frozen\
  \ for the best texture, if we do have frozen steaks on hand, from now on we\u2019\
  ll cook them straight from the freezer. Freeze steaks, uncovered, overnight on a\
  \ baking sheet (this dries them out to prevent excess splattering during cooking),\
  \ then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, place in a zipper-lock bag, and return\
  \ to freezer. To ensure that the steaks brown evenly, add oil to the skillet until\
  \ it measures 1/8 inch deep. And because frozen steaks will splatter more during\
  \ searing, use a large skillet."
