directions: 'Remove the neck and giblets from a thawed whole turkey.


  Prepare the turkey brine according to recipe directions. Brine for 18-24 hours.


  Remove the turkey from the brine. Rinse the turkey with cold water and pat it dry.


  Spatchcock the turkey by removing the backbone with poultry shears or kitchen shears.
  Flip the bird so that it is breast side up, place it on a sheet pan and flatten
  the bird by pressing hard on each breast until the ribs snap. Tuck the wings under
  the breast and arrange the drumsticks and thighs to flatten them without tearing
  the skin or breaking any joints.


  Make a butter rub by mixing softened butter with salt and pepper.


  Generously cover the turkey with the butter mixture. Take care to butter joints
  where the wings and thighs connect to the breast.


  Roast the turkey at 400 degrees F. for about 1 hour and 10 minutes until the interior
  part of the breast meat reaches 165 degrees F. The thickest part of the thigh should
  also read 165 degrees F.


  Baste the turkey every 20-30 minutes with melted butter and pan drippings.


  Remove the turkey from the oven. Let it rest for 10-20 minutes, then carve and serve.'
