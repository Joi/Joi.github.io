description: 'WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

  We chose a hearty boneless lamb shoulder roast for this recipe, and it remained
  tender and juicy during the extended cooking time. A hefty amount of spices is key
  in this dish, but too much produced a chalky texture. To avoid this pitfall, we
  bloomed the spices with the aromatics, allowing us to use a more moderate amount.
  Some sugar and red wine vinegar also enhanced the flavors of the dish.'
difficulty: ''
directions: 'Microwave onions, oil, paprika, garlic, tomato paste, cumin, cardamom,
  and cayenne in bowl, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes;
  transfer to slow cooker.


  Stir tomatoes and their juice, broth, tapioca, vinegar, bay leaves, and sugar into
  slow cooker. Season lamb with salt and pepper and stir into slow cooker. Cover and
  cook until lamb is tender, 9 to 10 hours on low or 6 to 7 hours on high.


  Discard bay leaves. Using large spoon, skim fat from surface of sauce. Adjust consistency
  with hot water as needed. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste.
  Serve.
