directions: 'Melt butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add reserved shrimp
  shells and cook until spotty brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in onions, celery, and
  carrots and cook until beginning to soften, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook
  until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until
  lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add
  clam juice, wine, and thyme and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
  until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes.
