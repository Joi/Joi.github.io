directions: "Make the panade. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the panko and\
  \ milk until combined. Set mixture aside to soak for 5 to 10 minutes while you prepare\
  \ the other ingredients.\n\nCombine remaining ingredients. Add the ground beef,\
  \ ground pork, garlic, eggs, Parmesan, fresh herbs, onion and Worcestershire sauce\
  \ to the mixing bowl. Sprinkle the oregano, salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper\
  \ flakes evenly on top. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until evenly combined,\
  \ being careful not to over-mix the ingredients.\n\nChill (optional step). To make\
  \ the meatballs easier to form, I recommend covering and chilling the mixture in\
  \ the refrigerator for 1 hour. But if you\u2019re pressed for time, you can skip\
  \ this step.\n\nPrep oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 425\xB0F and line a\
  \ large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nForm the meatballs. Using a\
  \ medium cookie scoop or a spoon, scoop and roll the mixture into 2-tablespoon balls\
  \ and place them on the prepared baking sheet. (I recommend greasing your hands\
  \ with a bit of olive oil to prevent the mixture from sticking.)\n\nBake. Bake for\
  \ 10-12 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer measures the internal temperature\
  \ of the meatballs to be 160\xB0F. Remove pan and transfer to a wire cooling rack.\n\
  \nServe. Serve meatballs immediately and enjoy!"
