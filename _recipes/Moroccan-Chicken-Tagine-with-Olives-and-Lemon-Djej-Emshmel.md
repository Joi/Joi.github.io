description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nFor our Moroccan chicken tagine recipe, we focused\
  \ on the elements that give the dish its Moroccan character: spices, olives, and\
  \ lemon. We experimented with a broad range of spices until we landed on a blend\
  \ that was short on ingredients but long on flavor. Cumin, ginger, and cinnamon\
  \ added depth and warmth, cayenne offered up some heat, coriander echoed the lemon\u2019\
  s citrusy notes, and paprika brought a smokiness and deep color. Moroccan green\
  \ olives being too hard to find and most other types being too mild, we sampled\
  \ all sort of olives, until we came across Greek green olives, which had the assertiveness\
  \ we were looking for. Traditionally, Moroccan preserved lemons are used to flavor\
  \ the tagine recipe, but since they are sold only in specialty stores, we were determined\
  \ to make fresh lemons work. We found that cooking lemon zest strips with the onion\
  \ and spices imitated the low, deep notes of preserved lemons, and stirring in grated\
  \ lemon zest and lemon juice at the end brought a welcome brightness. "
