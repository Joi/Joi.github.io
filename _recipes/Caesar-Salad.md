difficulty: Medium
directions: 'Salad


  Place water into mixing bowl, insert simmering basket and add eggs. Cook 12 min/Varoma/speed
  1. Remove simmering basket with spatula and place eggs under cold running water
  to stop the cooking process.


  Peel eggs, separate egg whites from egg yolks (see Tip), reserve yolks for dressing.
  Chop egg whites into small cubes and set aside.


  Set oven to broil, low setting. Place oven rack in middle of oven.


  Place a bowl onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in bread cubes. Place bread cubes onto
  a baking sheet, drizzle olive oil over bread cubes and mix with spatula. Place baking
  sheet under broiler, turn bread cubes carefully while baking until golden brown
  and set aside.


  Place a large salad bowl onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in lettuce. Add croutons
  (bread cubes) and chopped egg whites to large salad bowl and set aside.


  Dressing


  Place a pitcher onto mixing bowl lid and weigh in 5 oz olive oil. Set aside.


  Place Parmesan cheese into mixing bowl and grate 5 sec/speed 7. Set scale to zero,
  then using a spoon, remove 3.5 oz of Parmesan cheese (scale will show minus ''-
  3.5 oz'') and reserve for sprinkling on finished salad. Grate the remaining 2 oz
  of cheese a further 10 sec/speed 10.


  Add garlic, anchovy fillets, mustard, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, pepper,
  salt, 3.5 oz olive oil and reserved egg yolks and mix 20 sec/speed 7. Scrape down
  sides of mixing bowl with spatula.


  Mix 1 min/speed 5 while pouring the reserved 5 oz of olive oil in a slow steady
  stream onto mixing bowl lid, letting it drizzle around the measuring cup onto rotating
  blades to an emulsion. Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula.


  Add water and stir 5 sec/speed 3. Pour half the dressing (see Tip) over Caesar Salad
  and serve immediately.


  Tips & tricks


  Eggs should be soft boiled: egg yolk liquid, egg whites just cooked.


  This recipe makes enough dressing for two salads. Add as much dressing as you wish
  and store the rest for up to one week in the refrigerator.


  Parmesan cheese can be reserved and added to salad before serving.'
