directions: "First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil,\
  \ you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add \xBC\
  \ cup of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and\
  \ heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don\u2019t burn.\
  \ Remove from heat and set aside.\n\nHeat the remaining \xBC cup of oil in your\
  \ wok over medium heat. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir occasionally\
  \ for 30 seconds. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another\
  \ minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the\
  \ meat and fry it until it\u2019s cooked through.\n\nAdd the spicy bean sauce to\
  \ the mixture and stir it in well. Add \u2154 cups of chicken broth to the wok and\
  \ stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu\
  \ and also put a \xBC cup of water in a small bowl with your cornstarch and mix\
  \ until thoroughly combined.\n\nAdd the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir.\
  \ Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash\
  \ in a little more water or chicken stock.)\n\nThen add your chili oil from before\u2014\
  peppers and all! Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula\
  \ to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add\
  \ the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir until the\
  \ scallions are just wilted.\n\nServe with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn\
  \ powder as a garnish if desired."
