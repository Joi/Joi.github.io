description: "The staling of bread and other starch-based foods is due to a process\
  \ called retrogradation. In the bread-making process, water hydrates the starches\
  \ in the flour and then, as the loaf bakes, the starches gelatinize and soften.\
  \ Over time, the starches in that baked loaf crystallize and incorporate water into\
  \ the crystalline structure, leading to an apparently dry, stale loaf. The good\
  \ news is that the water doesn\u2019t travel very far: Most of it remains trapped\
  \ within the starch crystals. This proximity makes the retrogradation process reversible,\
  \ at least for a little while.\n\nToasting slices of bread is one way to release\
  \ water from the starch crystals and thus revive the bread. But what if you want\
  \ to reverse the staling of an entire loaf? That requires a more gentle touch because\
  \ in order to avoid water loss due to evaporation, you need to gradually heat the\
  \ entire loaf to the gelation point (about 140 degrees)\u2014but without heating\
  \ it to the boiling point of water (212 degrees). In addition, with drier crusty\
  \ breads like baguettes and boules, you also need to supply water to the exterior\
  \ of the loaf to ensure that all the starches can properly soften."
