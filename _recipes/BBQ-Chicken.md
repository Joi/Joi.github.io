<div class="box box-description content"><p>Inspired by: <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/the-best-barbecue-chicken-recipe.html">&quot;The Best Barbecue Chicken Recipe&quot; by J. Kenji López-Alt</a></p>
</div>		<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<div class="box box-notes"><p>In his recipe, Kenji Lopez-Alt says &quot;Note: This recipe calls for a large chicken. Do not try it with a smaller chicken, as it will dry out too much while cooking.&quot; However, he doesn't explain why. I think this is basically reverse sear so I'm not sure how it would become too dry. I tried to post a question on the site, but for some reason it didn't get posted. When I cooked a smaller (3.5 lbs) chicken, it came out juicy and great.</p>
