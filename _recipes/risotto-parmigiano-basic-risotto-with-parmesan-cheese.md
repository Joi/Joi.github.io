description: Th is is the simplest _risotto_ - there is nothing extra to hide a mediocre
  rice, a bad butter, or a tasteless _Parmigiano_. Everything has to be perfect .
  This recipe is the basic one for all the risotto dishes in this book. Once you've
  made it a few times, you'll find it comes as second nature. It's a good idea to
  have some boiling water on the stove, in case you run out of stock before the risotto
  is finished.
