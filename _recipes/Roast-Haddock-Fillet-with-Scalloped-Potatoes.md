directions: 'Carefully pick over the haddock fillets, making sure there are no bones
  in them. Set the fish aside.


  Saute the scallions and garlic in the oil for five minutes. Add the bacon and cook
  it until it and the garlic are lightly browned. Add the chicken stock and cook over
  high heat until it has been reduced to half a cup (about 15 minutes) and the garlic
  cloves are soft.


  Meanwhile preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Slice the potatoes very thin (you will
  need enough to cover the surface of the fish fillets). If necessary, slice more
  later if you find you have not done enough. Toss the slices in the olive oil.


  Peel the garlic cloves. Spread the garlic-bacon mixture over the bottom of a large
  heavy-bottom baking pan. Lay the fish fillets skin side down on top. Sprinkle with
  thyme, salt and pepper. Arrange the potatoes in barely overlapping layers on top
  of the fish fillets. Season with salt and pepper and bake, uncovered, for 10 to
  15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.'
