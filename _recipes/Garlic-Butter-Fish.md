directions: 'Cut the fish into pieces, not to thin for easy pan-frying. Season the
  fish with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Coat the fish with corn starch.
  Set aside.


  Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Set aside.


  Heat up a skillet (preferably non-stick) on medium heat. Add the cooking oil and
  once the oil is heated, pan-fry the fish in a single layer until both sides turn
  crispy and golden brown. Use a wooden spatula or tong to gently flip the fish over.
  Try not to break the fish.


  Remove the fish from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Toss the fish with the
  Garlic Butter Sauce and serve immediately with lemon wedges.'
