directions: 'Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper
  and place in an earthenware baking dish in one layer, skin side up. Sprinkle with
  red pepper, garlic, fennel and rosemary and drizzle with olive oil. Rub seasoning
  into thighs on all sides. Tuck lemon wedges here and there. Let marinate for 15
  minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees.


  Put baking dish in oven, uncovered, and roast until skin browns lightly, about 20
  minutes. Scatter olives evenly over chicken and add broth. Cover tightly and bake
  for 1 hour, until meat is very tender when probed with a skewer.


  Remove thighs and lemon wedges and arrange on a platter. Keep warm. Pour pan juices
  into a saucepan and quickly skim fat from surface. Over high heat, simmer rapidly
  until reduced by half. Spoon juices over chicken, sprinkle with parsley and serve.'
