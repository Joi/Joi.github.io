directions: "1. Set oven rack to lowest position and place a baking stone or Baking\
  \ Steel on it. Preheat oven to 500\xB0F (260\xB0C). Allow to preheat for at least\
  \ 45 minutes before adding turkey. Meanwhile, rinse turkey and carefully pat dry\
  \ with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper. (If turkey has been\
  \ dry-brined, omit rinsing and salting steps; see note.) Set turkey breast side\
  \ up in a V-rack over a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.\n\n2. Transfer rimmed baking\
  \ sheet with turkey directly to baking stone. Immediately close oven and reduce\
  \ oven temperature to 300\xB0F (150\xB0C). Roast until turkey is golden brown and\
  \ deepest part of breast registers 150\xB0F (66\xB0C) on an instant-read thermometer\
  \ and legs register at least 165\xB0F (74\xB0C), 3 to 4 hours total. (Check on turkey\
  \ after 2 hours. If skin looks like it is not browning fast enough, turn on convection\
  \ or increase oven temperature by 50\xB0F/10\xB0C.) Remove from oven and let rest\
  \ at least 30 minutes before carving.\n\n3. While turkey is roasting, chop reserved\
  \ turkey neck into 1-inch chunks with a cleaver. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over\
  \ medium-high heat until shimmering. Add turkey neck, onion, carrot, and celery\
  \ and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add\
  \ stock, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer\
  \ for 1 hour, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You should have a little\
  \ over 1 quart of fortified stock; if not, add water or more chicken stock to equal\
  \ 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.\n\n4. Finely chop turkey gizzard\
  \ and liver (if desired). Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add\
  \ chopped giblets and cook, stirring frequently, until just cooked through, about\
  \ 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3\
  \ minutes. Whisking constantly, add fortified broth in a thin, steady stream. Bring\
  \ to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3\
  \ cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n5. Carve turkey and serve with\
  \ gravy."
