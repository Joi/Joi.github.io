directions: 'Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Adjust oven rack to the top level.


  Put onion and olive oil in a skillet, turn heat to medium, and cook until the onion
  is golden. Add garlic, and saute until it turns pale gold; then add the tomatoes
  and a little salt, and stir. Simmer 20 minutes, until the oil floats on the surface
  of the mixture. Add the capers, oregano and pepper. Stir and cook a minute longer,
  and remove from heat.


  Rinse and dry the fish. Select a baking dish large enough to hold the fillets folded
  in half lengthwise in a single layer. Spread a tablespoon of the tomato mixture
  in the bottom of the dish.


  Dip each fillet in the tomato mixture to coat both sides, fold lengthwise, and arrange
  in the baking dish. Pour remaining sauce over fish, and bake, uncovered, 5 minutes
  or slightly longer, until fish is done.


  Remove from the oven, tip the dish and spoon the sauce from the dish into a saucepan.
  Cook the sauce over high heat until it has returned to its original thickness. Spoon
  it back over the fish, and serve directly from the baking dish.'
