directions: 'In medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions to skillet,
  and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and
  ginger, and cook another 2 minutes. Add garam masala, tomato paste and salt; cook
  and stir 2 minutes.


  Place chicken pieces in a slow cooker, then add tomato paste mixture, lime zest
  and juice, coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir everything together, cover and cook
  on low heat setting for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, until the chicken is cooked through. (You
  may let it cook up to 7 hours if necessary, but the chicken may be very soft and
  shred.) Garnish with cilantro and serve with basmati or jasmine rice, and naan if
  you have some.'
