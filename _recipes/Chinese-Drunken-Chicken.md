directions: "Debone the chicken leg quarters, keeping the skin on. Keep the bones\
  \ to make a homemade stock, which you\u2019ll be using in this recipe. You might\
  \ be able to ask your butcher to help you with this step!\n\nIn a small pot, add\
  \ your reserved chicken bones, 2 \xBD cups water, and ginger. Bring to a boil and\
  \ simmer over low heat for at least 1 hour (or longer). We\u2019ll need 1 \xBD cups\
  \ of chicken broth for the recipe. You can also eliminate this step if you want\
  \ to use store-bought chicken stock.\n\nRinse off your de-boned chicken and pat\
  \ thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Grab 2 pieces of aluminum foil, each about\
  \ 12\u201D long. Lay each piece of chicken onto a piece of foil, and sprinkle with\
  \ \xBC teaspoon salt. Roll up the chicken lengthwise, and then wrap in the foil,\
  \ twisting both sides to form a candy-like bundle.\n\nSteam the chicken in the foil\
  \ over high heat for 20 minutes, covered. Turn off the heat and let the chicken\
  \ sit in the steamer for another 5 minutes with the lid tightly closed.\n\nTransfer\
  \ the foil wrapped chicken to an ice bath, and let it sit there for 10-15 minutes,\
  \ until the chicken is completely cool. This step ensures that the juices remain\
  \ locked in and improves the chicken\u2019s overall texture.\n\nNow it\u2019s time\
  \ to make the brine. In a non-reactive container (I used a glass loaf pan. Anything\
  \ narrow and deep, where the chicken can remain submerged, will work), add the 1\
  \ \xBD cups chicken broth, 1 \xBD cups shaoxing wine, sugar, salt, and goji berries.\
  \ Once the chicken is cool, unwrap the chicken and place in the brine. Cover and\
  \ refrigerate for 24 hours.v\n\nSlice and serve cold or at room temperature. This\
  \ dish is usually served as a cold appetizer. Remember to store the chicken in the\
  \ brine until serving and use clean utensil whenever coming contact with the brine\
  \ and chicken. Consume the chicken within 3 days."
