STOVE TOP:

Wash and pat dry lamb shanks with paper towel.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy based pot.

Sear two shanks in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Repeat with remaining shanks and oil.

Transfer to a plate, tent with foil to keep warm, set aside.

To the pan juices, saut√© the carrots and diced onions until softened, (about 3 minutes), then add garlic and cook for 1 minute.

Return the shanks back into the pot; season with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper.

Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook for 4-5 minutes to brown.

Add stock, wine, puree, tomato paste, bullion and herbs.

Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is falling apart.

Garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes or rice.
