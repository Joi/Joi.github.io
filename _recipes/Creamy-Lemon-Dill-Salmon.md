directions: 'Set oven to 400F


  Lightly coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil and heat on medium high
  heat until hot but not smoking.


  Season the salmon on all sides with salt and pepper, and then sear it on both sides.
  Remove the salmon to a baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until just done
  through.


  Meanwhile make the sauce by adding the shallot to the browning pan and saute for
  a minute or two to soften. Add the wine and let the wine bubble away to reduce for
  a couple of minutes.


  Add the lemon juice and cream to the pan and bring up to a simmer. Add the fresh
  dill and the capers. Add salt and pepper to taste.


  When the salmon is done, add it to the pan, nestling it down into the sauce. Spoon
  some of the sauce over the fish, and garnish with lemon and more fresh dill.


  Serve right away on a bed of wilted spinach, with couscous or a rice pilaf on the
  side.'

Make a lighter lemon sauce using the Greek egg thickening method, you can see it in my recipe for CHICKEN IN LEMON SAUCE WITH OLIVES. The sauce will be silky, thick, and lemony, without any cream at all.

If you aren't a dill fan, you might try tarragon.
