description: "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nStore-bought ground turkey is fine and pasty,\
  \ and it produced a dense, mushy meatloaf when we simply swapped it into a traditional\
  \ meatloaf recipe. We dropped the usual panade from our recipe since we found that\
  \ it only exacerbated the mushiness. Instead, we stirred in quick oats, which added\
  \ just the right amount of chew and helped open up the texture of the densely packed\
  \ turkey. To help give the turkey\u2019s thin juices richer flavor and fuller body,\
  \ we added cornstarch to the mix along with grated Parmesan cheese and butter, and\
  \ we used egg yolks instead of whole eggs. To avoid overwhelming the mild flavor\
  \ of the meat with too many add-ins, we stirred in a modest amount of onion, as\
  \ well as garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and Dijon mustard. To finish it off,\
  \ we made a flavor-packed glaze and ensured that it stuck by applying a first coat\
  \ to the meatloaf and letting it cook until the glaze was tacky. We then added a\
  \ second coat of glaze, which stuck to this base coat in an even layer. To help\
  \ the loaf cook evenly, we baked it on an aluminum foil\u2013lined wire rack set\
  \ in a rimmed baking sheet."

directions: 'FOR THE MEATLOAF: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat
  oven to 350 degrees. Line wire rack with aluminum foil and set in rimmed baking
  sheet. Melt butter in 10-inch skillet over low heat. Stir baking soda into melted
  butter. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt, increase heat to medium, and cook, stirring
  frequently, until onion is softened and beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add
  garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in Worcestershire
  and continue to cook until slightly reduced, about 1 minute longer. Transfer onion
  mixture to large bowl and set aside. Combine oats, cornstarch, 3/4 teaspoon salt,
  and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in second bowl.


  FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk all ingredients in saucepan until sugar dissolves. Bring mixture
  to simmer over medium heat and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes; set
  aside.


  Stir egg yolks and mustard into cooled onion mixture until well combined. Add turkey,
  Parmesan, parsley, and oat mixture; using your hands, mix until well combined. Transfer
  turkey mixture to center of prepared rack. Using your wet hands, shape into 9 by
  5-inch loaf. Using pastry brush, spread half of glaze evenly over top and sides
  of meatloaf. Bake meatloaf for 40 minutes.


  Brush remaining glaze onto top and sides of meatloaf and continue to bake until
  meatloaf registers 160 degrees, 35 to 40 minutes longer. Let meatloaf cool for 20
  minutes before slicing and serving.'
