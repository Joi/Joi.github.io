directions: "In the bowl of a food processor, make a paste with the garlic, pepper,\
  \ thyme, and a pinch of salt. Place the meat in a shallow vessel. Rub the paste\
  \ over the meat. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and Worcestershire. Pour\
  \ this mixture over the meat. Turn the meat to coat in the marinade. Refrigerate\
  \ for at least 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, prepare a grill for high heat. (See notes above).\
  \ Wipe off excess marinade. Season meat on both sides generously with salt and pepper.\
  \ Grill over hot coals uncovered, 2 to 3 minutes a side until a thermometer registers\
  \ 125\xBAF for medium rare or 135\xBAF for medium. Transfer meat to a board to rest\
  \ for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Reference the video above if\
  \ you are having a hard time figuring out which way is against the grain \u2014\
  \ it\u2019s not always easy to tell."
