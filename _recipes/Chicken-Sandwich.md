description: "To make a really good chicken sandwich you must use freshly cooked chicken.\
  \ If you want to use leftover chicken, you will need about 3 cups (750 ml) for 6\
  \ sandwiches.\rMAKES 6 SANDWICHES"
difficulty: Easy
directions: "Poach the chicken: Put the stock, celery, onion, carrot, bay leaf, and\
  \ some salt in a large saucepan. Heat to a boil and boil, uncovered, for 10 minutes.\
  \ Add the chicken breasts, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes on\
  \ each side. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool in the broth\
  \ for 30 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and. cut it into julienne\
  \ strips.\n\rStrain the double-rich chicken stock and save it to use in a soup or\
  \ sauce. Assemble the sandwiches: Spread some mayonnaise generously over one side\
  \ of each slice of bread. Mound half the lettuce on half the bread slices, leaving\
  \ a 1-inch (2\xBD cm) margin of bread . Mound the chicken on top of the lettuce\
  \ and season with salt and a little Worcestershire sauce. Cover with the remaining\
  \ lettuce, then another slice of bread. Press firmly on the edges to seal the sandwiches.\
  \ Trim the crusts if you wish. When you cut the sandwiches in half, they will have\
  \ the characteristic Harry's Bar shape shown in the photograph on page 46. Serve\
  \ immediately.\r\rWINE NOTES\rItalian: Tocai~Volpe Pasini\rAmerican: Chardonnay~Colbertson"
