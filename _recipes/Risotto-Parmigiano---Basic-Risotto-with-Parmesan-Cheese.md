description: Th is is the simplest _risotto_ - there is nothing extra to hide a mediocre
  rice, a bad butter, or a tasteless _Parmigiano_. Everything has to be perfect .
  This recipe is the basic one for all the risotto dishes in this book. Once you've
  made it a few times, you'll find it comes as second nature. It's a good idea to
  have some boiling water on the stove, in case you run out of stock before the risotto
  is finished.

directions: "Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep it at a bare simmer.\n\
  \rHeat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart (2 \xBE liter) saucepan and cook\
  \ the onion over medium heat, stirring until the onion is golden but not brown,\
  \ about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the rice\
  \ well with the oil and onion. Turn the heat to medium-high, add about \xBD cup\
  \ (125 ml) of the simmering stock, and keep the mixture boiling, stirring constantly.\
  \ As soon as the stock has been absorbed, add another \xBD cup (125 ml) of stock\
  \ and stir until it is absorbed. You may have to adjust the heat from time to time\
  \ - the _risotto_ has to keep boiling, but it must not stick to the pot. If your\
  \ _risotto_ tends to stick, put the pot on a Flame Tamer. Continue adding stock\
  \ about \xBD cup (125 ml) at a time, stirring constantly and waiting until each\
  \ portion is absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is creamy and tender\
  \ on the outside with each grain still distinct and firm. This will take at least\
  \ 20 minutes, maybe as long as 30 minutes, depending on your pot and your stove.\
  \ If the rice is still a bit hard in the middle after you have used all but a few\
  \ tablespoons of the stock, add boiling water \xBC cup (60 ml) at a time, stirring\
  \ it in as you did the stock, until each grain of rice is tender but still has the\
  \ slightest bit of firmness and the mixture is creamy.\n\rRemove the pan from the\
  \ heat and vigorously stir in the butter and the _Parmesan_. This stirring will\
  \ make the _risotto_ even creamier. Taste and season with salt and pepper. While\
  \ continuing to stir vigorously, add the few remaining tablespoons of hot stock\
  \ (or boiling water if you've used all the stock) to make the consistency softer\
  \ and softer. In Italy we call it _all'onda_ like a wave. Taste carefully for seasoning\
  \ and serve immediately, passing a small bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nNote:\n\
  \nThere are several good ways to use leftover _risotto_. It will not taste the same\
  \ as when it is freshly made, but it's surprisingly good.\n\nTo reheat _risotto_\
  \ in a saucepan: Use a nonstick pan. Stir 2 or 3 tablespoons of stock or water into\
  \ the _risotto_ and heat it in a covered pot, stirring frequently. If the _risotto_\
  \ is not creamy enough, add a little more liquid until you have a texture you like.\
  \ To reheat _risotto_ in a frying pan: Use a nonstick pan. Heat the pan over medium\
  \ heat and melt 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter. When the butter is hot, add rounded\
  \ tablespoons of _risotto_ and flatten it into pancakes with the back of the spoon.\
  \ Fry the _risotto_ pancakes until they are golden brown, then turn them and fry\
  \ the other side, adding more butter as needed.\n\n\rWINE NOTES\rItalian: Arneis\
