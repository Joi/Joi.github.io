directions: 'Remove giblets from duck cavity, and cut off wing tips. Trim excess fat
  and skin from the body openings.


  Using a small paring knife, poke holes all over the duck''s breast, legs, and back.
  Insert the knife at an angle to avoid penetrating the meat. There is about 1/4 inch
  of fat beneath the skin on the breasts and thighs and about 1/8 inch on the legs
  and back; insert as deeply as possible without making a cut more than about 1/2
  inch long.


  Place the duck in a large stockpot. Add onion, carrots, celery, neck, wing tips,
  and giblets. Add enough water to completely cover duck. Remove duck from the pot.
  Add parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and place pot over high heat. Bring to
  a boil, skimming off any scum that forms.


  Carefully return duck to the pot, bring back to a boil, and then immediately reduce
  heat to a simmer. Place a plate with a heavy can on top of the duck to keep it submerged,
  and simmer for 45 minutes, removing any additional scum as it forms but allowing
  fat to accumulate.


  Remove duck, and pat dry, being careful to avoid tearing the skin. Cool to room
  temperature. At this point, you can move on to roasting, or you can refrigerate
  the duck on a dish, uncovered, which forces some additional fat out as the skin
  contracts and produces a crispier skin.


  Strain the stock, discarding solids, and refrigerate it overnight. The fat will
  rise to the top and you can skim that off. Freeze and save the fat for up to a year.
  The stock can be reduced (concentrated) and used for making gravy (with some of
  the duck fat) or reserved for other uses.


  If you refrigerated the bird, remove from refrigerator, and warm on the counter
  for 3 hours.


  Heat oven to 500 F. Place an oven rack one level up from the bottom and heat a roasting
  pan that can hold a roasting rack. Don''t heat the rack.


  Mix together orange zest, salt, pepper, and rosemary. Sprinkle half the mixture
  inside the duck, and sprinkle remaining on the outside, patting to make it stick.


  Stuff the cavity with the orange, onion, and garlic, and roast the duck on the rack
  for 30 minutes (rotate front to back after 15 minutes).


  Remove from oven, and let rest 15 minutes before carving.'
