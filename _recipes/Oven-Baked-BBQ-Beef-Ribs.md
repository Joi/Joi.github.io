directions: 'Rinse ribs and dry COMPLETELY with paper towels.


  Douse dry ribs with liquid smoke if using and rub it in.


  Lightly coat ribs in olive oil.


  Mix together seasoning and sprinkle generously over ribs, front and back. (You don''t
  have to use all of seasoning mix)


  Massage the spices into the ribs, adding more olive oil to help distribute the spices
  well if needed.


  Place the ribs in a large ziplock bag or covered bowl and marinate in the fridge
  for 1-2 hours.


  Preheat the oven to 250 F.


  Place the ribs on a foil lined baking tray in a single layer.


  Add another piece of foil on top to create a pouch for the ribs to cook in. Be sure
  to seal the edges of the foil so that it''s tight and steam won''t seep out.


  Bake on the middle rack of 3 1/2 -4 hours. (Mine only needed 3 1/2 hours) Check
  on it after the 3 1/2 hour mark. The oven temperature is very low so you can afford
  to cook it a bit longer without worry)


  When the ribs are done to your liking, drain off the excess fat.


  Brush the ribs with desired amount of BBQ sauce.


  Broil on low until the sauce is sticky. (this won''t take long so keep an eye on
  it)


  Serve hot and enjoy!!'
