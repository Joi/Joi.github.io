TO STORE: Let your cooked salmon meuniere cool, and then place it in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

TO REHEAT ON THE STOVE: Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil in the pan so that the salmon does not dry out or stick to the pan. After about a minute, add your salmon piece to the skillet and let it heat for about 5 minutes per side until warm.

TO REHEAT IN THE MICROWAVE: Place your salmon meuniere on a microwave-safe plate, cover it with a paper towel, and microwave for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, I suggest checking your salmon, adjusting it for even heating, and continuing to microwave if necessary.

TO FREEZE: To freeze your salmon meuniere, place it in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 2 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.
