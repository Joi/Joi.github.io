directions: 'Melt the butter in a large (12-inch) oven safe cast iron skillet or similar
  sturdy-bottomed oven safe skillet over medium heat. Continue to heat, swirling the
  pan periodically, until it begins to brown.


  Reduce the heat to medium-low. Dredge both sides of the salmon fillets in the flour
  mixture. Shake off the excess then gently place them in the hot butter, top-side
  down. Cook without disturbing them for 3 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
  When the salmon turns opaque on the sides and starts to turn opaque on top, use
  a flexible spatula to flip the salmon.
