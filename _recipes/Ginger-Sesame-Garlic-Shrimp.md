directions: "1 Marinate the shrimp: In a medium bowl whisk together the soy sauce,\
  \ seasoned rice vinegar, and brown sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Then whisk\
  \ in the olive oil, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Place the shrimp\
  \ in the bowl with the marinade. Toss to coat with the marinade and chill until\
  \ ready to cook.\n\n2 Toast sesame seeds: If you haven't already done so, toast\
  \ the sesame seeds in a small saut\xE9 pan on medium high heat until lightly browned.\n\
  \n3 Stir-fry shrimp and green onions: Heat cooking oil in a large stick-free saut\xE9\
  \ pan or wok (can use seasoned cast iron) on high heat. When the oil is shimmering\
  \ hot, almost smoking, use a slotted spoon to move the shrimp from the marinade\
  \ into the hot pan. (Watch out, it will splatter.) Stir-fry for a minute.\n\nAdd\
  \ half of the sliced green onions. Continue to stir fry, turning the individual\
  \ shrimp over if necessary, until the shrimp are pink and just cooked through. No\
  \ more than 2 minutes max total cooking time, a minute on each side.\n\n4 Reduce\
  \ marinade: Remove shrimp from pan and transfer to a serving bowl. Place the remaining\
  \ marinade in the hot saut\xE9 pan and simmer it until it has reduced to a syrup.\n\
  \n5 Pour sauce over shrimp, sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onions: Pour over\
  \ the shrimp. Toss to coat. Sprinkle the shrimp with toasted sesame seeds and remaining\
  \ green onions.\n\nServe immediately with rice, soba noodles, rice noodles, bok\
  \ choy, spinach, broccoli, or asparagus."
