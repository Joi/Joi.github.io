directions: "Preheat oven to 240\xB0C/465\xB0F (220\xB0C fan forced).\n\nRub the lamb\
  \ with the olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\nUse a thin, sharp knife to make 12 incisions\
  \ in the lamb, deep as you can but without piercing through the bottom of the lamb.\
  \ (See photo in post and video\n\nStuff bits of rosemary and garlic slivers into\
  \ the holes (chopstick helpful!)\n\nPlace the onion, halved garlic bulb and rosemary\
  \ in the base of a roasting pan. Place the lamb on top. Pour water around.\n\nCover\
  \ with lid or tightly with a double layer of foil. Place in the oven, and TURN DOWN\
  \ to 180\xB0C/350\xB0F (160\xB0C fan).\n\nRoast, covered, for 3 hours. Remove foil,\
  \ turn up the oven to 220\xB0C/425\xB0F and roast for a further 20 to 30 minutes,\
  \ until the skin is browned and crisp. By now, you should be able to part the meat\
  \ with two forks.\n\nRemove lamb from the roasting pan and transfer to a plate.\
  \ Cover loosely with foil then a couple of tea towels and let it rest for at least\
  \ 20 minutes, up to a couple of hours (after this, you may want to reheat).\n\n\
  Serve with gravy (below). If you want to go all out, make Duck Fat Potatoes or Super\
  \ Crispy Roasted Potatoes!\n\nGRAVY\n\nTilt the pan and use a spoon to remove all\
  \ but around 2 tbsp of fat (try to avoid scooping out any juices).\n\nPlace the\
  \ roasting pan on the stove over medium high heat. Add the flour and stir to mix\
  \ in with the fat. Cook for 30 seconds.\n\nAdd the stock gradually and stir to combine.\
  \ Use a potato masher to mash the onion and garlic, making sure that all the garlic\
  \ squeezes out of the skin.\n\nAllow it to simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until it is\
  \ just before your desired consistency (it will thicken a bit as it cools), then\
  \ remove from the stove. Season to taste with salt and pepper, strain into bowl\
  \ being sure to squeeze all juices out of garlic etc, then transfer into gravy jug."
