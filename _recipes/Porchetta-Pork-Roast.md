directions: 'Score skin and fat all over pork, taking care not to cut down to the
  meat.


  In a food processor or mortar and pestle, combine fennel fronds, rosemary, sage,
  garlic, lemon zest, salt, fennel seed, red pepper flakes and black pepper. Pour
  in oil. Pulse or mash until it forms a paste. Rub all over pork. If using a boneless
  roast, tie with kitchen string at 2-inch intervals. Transfer to a large bowl and
  cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 6 hours and preferably overnight.


  Remove pork from refrigerator 1 to 2 hours before you want to cook it. Heat oven
  to 450 degrees. Transfer pork to a rimmed baking sheet and roast 35 minutes. Reduce
  temperature to 325 degrees and cook an additional 2 hours 45 minutes to 4 hours,
  until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 180 degrees,
  which will give you sliceable, tender meat. (Bone-in roasts will take longer than
  boneless ones.)


  Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 15 to 30 minutes before serving. Make
  sure everyone gets some of the cracklings.'
