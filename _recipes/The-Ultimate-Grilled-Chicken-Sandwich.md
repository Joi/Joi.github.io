directions: 'Add one tablespoon of olive oil to a hot pan along with the chopped sweet
  onion and chopped garlic. Saute for 1-2 minutes over medium heat, do not burn the
  garlic and onions.


  Add the balsamic, tomato paste and honey to the pan. Bring to a light boil and remove
  from the heat. At this point add 1-2 tablespoons of water to thin out the mixture.


  In a ziplock bag, add chicken, olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika and half of the
  honey balsamic sauce (reserve the rest for the grilling process). Make sure the
  chicken is completely coated in the seasonings. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours to allow
  the flavors to develop in the raw chicken.


  cook bacon in 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. Set aside till needed.


  shred cheddar cheese. Set aside till needed.


  slice tomatoes and set aside till needed.


  Heat the grill to 350-450 degrees so you get good scoring marks.


  Brush the chicken breasts with the remainder of the honey balsamic sauce and grill
  each side about 3-4 minutes(or it has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees
  F).


  Building the Sandwich


  Place the grilled chicken breast on a sheet pan and top each breast with a large
  slice of tomato (or two small slices), 2 slices of bacon and one ounce of shredded
  cheddar.


  Place the pan on the grill and close the lid to allow the cheddar to melt.


  **You can also melt the cheddar in your oven under the broiler.


  Place the finished topped chicken breasts on your choice of buns and enjoy!'
