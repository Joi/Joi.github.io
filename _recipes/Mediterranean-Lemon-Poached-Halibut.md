difficulty: null
directions: 'In a small bowl, mix all the spices, salt and pepper, to make the spice
  blend.


  Pat halibut fillet dry, and rub both sides with the spice rub. Set aside at room
  temperature for a few minutes.


  In a large cast iron skillet like this one, add 1 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  to coat the bottom of the skillet. Heat over medium heat until shimmering but not
  smoking. Add chopped onions, and cook over medium-low heat for 4 minutes, tossing
  regularly until translucent. Add garlic and cook another 30 seconds.


  Now add the chicken broth, wine, lemon juice, lemon zest, fresh herbs, and capers.


  Bring liquid to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and carefully add the fish in.
  Cover the skillet loosely with foil or a lid and cook on low for 8 to 10 minutes,
  or until the fish is opaque and flaky, firm but not dry.


  Remove the skillet from heat. Top the fish with more fresh herbs, capers, grated
  carrots, and chopped scallions.


  If you cooked the fish in one piece like I did, cut into desired portions and serve
  in shallow bowls with the lemon-wine poaching liquid. You can simply add crusty
  bread to sop up the liquid, or serve atop plain orzo or Lebanese rice!'

  notes: '<p>Recipe notes: Use a shallow skillet or pan, and select the size carefully.
    If there is too much or too little space left around the fish, there may be too
    much or too little liquid, and the fish could over- or under-cook. And when you
    cover the fish to cook, you only need to cover it loosely to trap just enough
    of the steam to cook the unexposed parts, but not so much that the cooking speed
    rises. Feel free to strain the poaching broth if you like before serving.</p>

    <p>Recommended for this Recipe: from our all-natural and organic spice collection,
    coriander and paprika. And from our Greek olive oils: Private Reserve extra virgin
    olive oil (from organically grown and processed Koroneiki olives).</p>
