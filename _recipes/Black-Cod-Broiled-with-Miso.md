directions: 'Heat broiler; set rack 3 to 4 inches from heat source. Combine first
  three ingredients in a small saucepan and, over low heat, bring almost to a boil,
  stirring occasionally just until blended; mixture will be fairly thin. Turn off
  heat.


  Put fillets in an ovenproof baking dish or skillet, preferably nonstick, and spoon
  half the sauce on top. Broil until sauce bubbles and begins to brown, then spoon
  remaining amount over fish. Continue to broil, adjusting heat or rack position if
  sauce or fish is browning too quickly, until fish is just cooked through. Serve
  immediately.'
