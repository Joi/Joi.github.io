directions: 'Combine soy sauce, light brown sugar and 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
  in a wide, shallow bowl (or small baking dish) and season with salt and plenty of
  black pepper. Place salmon skin-side up in the marinade and let sit for at least
  20 minutes, or up to 2 hours.


  Place a rack in the top third of the oven and heat the broiler.


  Place salmon skin-side up on a foil-lined baking sheet; discard the marinade. Transfer
  to oven and broil until the salmon is cooked through and the skin is bubbling and
  lightly crisped, 5 to 7 minutes.


  Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, tossing frequently
  until seeds are golden brown and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.


  Toss shallot rings with remaining 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar in a medium bowl
  and season with salt and pepper. Let sit for a minute or two to lightly pickle,
  then add the sesame seeds, herbs and sesame oil and toss to combine.


  Transfer salmon to a large serving platter and spoon the remaining marinade from
  the sheet pan over the fillets. Top with sesame and herb salad and serve.'
