directions: "Peel and devein the shrimp. Boil 2 cups of water in a large wok and stir\
  \ in the ground pork. Break up any clumps and cook for about 1 minute, until the\
  \ pork is no longer pink. Drain the pork in a mesh strainer and give it a quick\
  \ rinse. This will give you a much clearer, cleaner sauce.\n\nWash your wok and\
  \ place over medium high heat. Add the vegetable oil, garlic, ground pork, and shrimp\
  \ and stir-fry for 10-20 seconds. Add the wine and stir-fry for another 10 seconds.\
  \ Add the chicken stock, sesame oil, sugar, salt, and white pepper. Stir in the\
  \ peas.\n\nOnce the mixture comes to a simmer, stir in the cornstarch slurry a little\
  \ bit at a time. Let the mixture bubble and thicken. It should be able to coat a\
  \ spoon, but it shouldn\u2019t have a gloopy consistency. If it gets too thick,\
  \ add a little more chicken stock. If it\u2019s too thin, add more slurry.\n\nSpread\
  \ the slightly beaten egg and scallion across the mixture and let simmer for 5 seconds.\
  \ Use your spatula to fold the egg into the sauce with a few strokes. Serve over\
  \ white rice."
