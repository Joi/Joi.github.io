directions: 'Toast the pita bread in your toaster oven until it is crisp but not browned.
  Heat 3 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan. Break the pita bread into pieces, and place
  in the heated oil. Fry briefly until browned, tossing frequently. Add salt, pepper
  and 1/2 tsp of sumac. Remove the pita chips from the heat and place on paper towels
  to drain.


  In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, green onions
  with the sliced radish and parsley.


  To make the lime vinaigrette, whisk together the lime juice, olive oil and spices
  in a small bowl.


  Dress the salad with the vinaigrette and toss lightly. Finally, add the pita chips,
  and more sumac if you like, and toss one more time. Transfer to small serving bowls
  or plates. Enjoy!'
