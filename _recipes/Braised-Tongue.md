directions: 'Pour the neutral oil into a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven set over
  medium heat. Sweat onion 5 minutes, stirring constantly so no color develops.


  Add the celery and carrot and 3 tablespoons of water. Cover with a tightfitting
  lid, and let the vegetables steam for a few minutes, being careful not to scorch.
  Add more water if necessary.


  Arrange the tongue in the pot, and add the parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns,
  red-wine vinegar and salt. Pour in enough water to just barely cover the tongue.
  Cover with a lid, and bring to a boil.


  Once the tongue braise has come to a boil, remove the lid, and reduce to a simmer.
  Cut a round of parchment the diameter of the pot and set it directly on top of the
  braising liquid. Simmer the tongue 4 hours, adding more water if needed to keep
  the tongue just covered. The tongue tends to suck up a lot of water quite quickly.


  Remove the tongue from the braising liquid. Strain the braising liquid (discard
  the solids), and return liquid to the pot. Peel the thick outer skin off the tongue
  while it is still warm. Trim off any fat or gristle, then return the tongue to the
  braising liquid and let cool completely.


  To serve, cut the tongue crosswise into thin slices, and arrange on a platter in
  a single layer. Drizzle with a few drops of the braising liquid. Spoon the gribiche
  over the tongue, and top with some fresh-picked parsley leaves and a generous glug
  of olive oil.'
