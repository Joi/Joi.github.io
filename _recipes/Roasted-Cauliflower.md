directions: 'Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place cauliflower in a large mixing bowl.
  Pour on enough olive oil to coat (a few tablespoons). Season generously with salt
  and pepper and toss gently until evenly coated.


  Lay cauliflower pieces out on a baking sheet. Drizzle any remaining oil from the
  bowl on top. Bake, turning once, until caramelized on edges and tender, 25 to 30
  minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, as a side dish. You can also sprinkle
  it with a very good aged vinegar. Or, cut florets into smaller pieces and add to
  salads.'
