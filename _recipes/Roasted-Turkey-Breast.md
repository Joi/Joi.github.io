description: "Perhaps your family is small. Perhaps your friends all bailed on you\
  \ the week before Thanksgiving. Perhaps only half your family eats meat. Perhaps\
  \ you simply don\u2019t enjoy leftovers. (Weirdo.) Or perhaps you just had a craving\
  \ for turkey in February and have no reason to cook a whole bird. Point is, there\
  \ are any number of reasons you might have for not wanting to roast an entire turkey,\
  \ but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be deprived of juicy meat, crispy skin,\
  \ and turkey-saturated stuffing, right?\n\nCooking a turkey breast is far easier\
  \ than cooking a whole turkey, since you only have a single final target temperature\
  \ in mind, instead of having to worry about the legs and breasts cooking at different\
  \ rates. As soon as that breast is at 150\xB0F, you can pull it out of the oven\
  \ and let it rest.\n\nI\u2019m the kind of guy who likes stuffing with my turkey,\
  \ and this method makes it easy. Just plop the breast down on top of a pan of stuffing,\
  \ throw it into a hot oven, and let it go. About halfway through cooking, the stuffing\
  \ will threaten to burn. Do not panic\u2014all you\u2019ve got to do is remove the\
  \ pan, transfer the turkey to a rack set on a rimmed baking sheet, and put it back\
  \ in the oven on its own to finish roasting. Once the turkey is cooked, pour the\
  \ pan juices over the stuffing and pop the stuffing back in the oven for one final\
  \ crisp-up blast while the turkey rests.\n\nThe best part? The whole process goes\
  \ from fridge to table in under two hours. This is the kind of stuff Sunday supper\
  \ dreams are made of.\n\nNOTE: For the juiciest results and crispest skin, dry-brine\
  \ the bird and air-dry it overnight as described here."
