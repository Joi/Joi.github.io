  \ brown and crisp. Gently turn fish and cook another 2-3 minutes. Set fish aside\
  \ to rest.\n\nFOR THE GREENS:\n\nAdjust heat to medium, and add 3 tablespoons olive\
  \ oil to the same skillet. Quickly saut\xE9 garlic and red pepper flakes, approximately\
  \ 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add greens to the pan and season with salt and pepper.\

  \ before serving."
