directions: "1. Combine flour, paprika, black pepper, and salt and whisk to combine.\
  \ Transfer half of mixture to a large bowl and set aside. Add beer and egg to remaining\
  \ mixture and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Batter should have the consistency\
  \ of thick paint (add up to 1/2 cup more beer as necessary until proper consistency\
  \ is reached). Set aside.\n\n2. Combine mayonnaise and hot sauce in a medium bowl\
  \ and whisk until homogenous. Set aside.\n\n3. Heat oil in a deep fryer, Dutch oven,\
  \ or large wok to 350\xB0F. Transfer fish pieces to bowl with batter and turn to\
  \ coat thoroughly. Working one piece at a time, lift fish, let excess batter drip\
  \ off, then transfer to bowl with remaining flour mixture. Toss to coat thoroughly.\
  \ Lift carefully with tongs or dry fingers and slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat\
  \ with remaining fish.\n\n4. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all\
  \ sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plated and season\
  \ with salt.\n\n5. Divide tortillas into 8 double stacks. Top each with shredded\
  \ cabbage, 1 piece of fish, pickled red onions, chili mayo, and cilantro. Serve\
  \ with lime wedges."
