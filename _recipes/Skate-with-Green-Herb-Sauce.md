directions: 'Put the basil, chives, capers, parsley, garlic, lemon zest and lemon
  juice in a bowl. Stir in half the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.


  Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan or skillet. Dust the skate wings with flour,
  season with salt and pepper and add to the pan.


  Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, until the flesh has turned snowy white and is
  beginning to come away from the cartilage.


  Pour the prepared herb sauce over the fish and cook over low heat for another few
  minutes, then transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.'
