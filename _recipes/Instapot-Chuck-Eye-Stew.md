directions: "**Brown Meat:** Heat up Instant Pot using Saut\xE9 More. Wait until it\
  \ says HOT (prevents meat from sticking to the pot). Add 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil\
  \ in Instant Pot. Season one side generously with salt and black pepper. Add meat,\
  \ then brown each side for 2 minutes. While one side is browning, season the other\
  \ side with more salt and black pepper.\n\nAvoid overcrowding by browning meat in\
  \ batches.\n\n**Saute Onion & Garlic:** Set aside the browned short ribs. Add in\
  \ sliced onions, and saute until soften (~ 3 minutes). Add in chopped garlic, and\
  \ saute until fragrant (~30 seconds).\n\n**Saute Veggies & Spices:** Add in chopped\
  \ carrots, celery, thyme, and 2 bay leaves, then saute for 2 minutes.\n\n**Deglaze\
  \ Instant Pot:** Pour \xBD cup (125ml) red wine in Instant Pot and deglaze by scrubbing\
  \ the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Give it\
  \ a quick mix. Let the wine simmer for a minute to allow some of the alcohol to\
  \ evaporate.\n\nAdd tomatoes, crush with spoon\n\n**Pressure Cook:** Add stock,\
  \ sugar, meat and pressure cook for 45 min. (Maybe shorter.)\n\nMix kudzu with water,\
  \ stir into stew.\n\nSeason with additional salt and serve. (I added 3 healthy pinches.)\n"
