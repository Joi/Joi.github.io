directions: 'Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef, season
  with salt and pepper and cook, breaking the beef into small pieces with a wooden
  spoon, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, leaving behind
  any drippings, and reduce the heat to medium.


  To the same skillet, add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook until golden brown,
  8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cooked mushrooms to the bowl with the beef. Add the
  oil, paprika, garlic, carrot and onion to the skillet and cook until the carrots
  are soft and the onion is lightly browned, about 10 minutes.


  Stir in the tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste has toasted and is evenly
  coating the vegetables, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire and 1 1/2
  cups of water to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and stir in the pasta. Cover and
  cook according to package directions until just al dente. Uncover, stir in the reserved
  beef and mushrooms and cook until heated through. Remove from the heat and stir
  in the cream cheese, sour cream, chives and parsley until the cream cheese melts
  and the sauce is creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.'
