directions: '1 Make the marinade: Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl. If sugar
  is an ingredient in the marinade you are using, stir until the sugar is completely
  dissolved.


  2 Marinate the salmon fillets: Cut fillets 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Place marinade
  ingredients in a large casserole dish (or a plate with sides so the marinade doesn''t
  run). Coat the salmon fillets in the marinade and then place them skinless-side
  down in the marinade.


  Marinate for 20 minutes for a quick marinade (can do this at room temperature while
  you are preparing the grill) or if you have more time, from 1 to 2 hours in the
  refrigerator.


  Before grilling, remove fillets from marinade and discard the marinade. Generously
  rub or brush oil on both sides of fish fillets.


  3 Prepare the grill: Prepare the grill for high direct heat (if you are using a
  charcoal grill, prepare one side of the grill for high direct heat and the other
  side with fewer coals for indirect heating).


  When the grill is hot (you should be able to hold your hand one inch above the grill
  grates for only 1 second), brush the grill grates with oil. (The best way to do
  that is to fold up a paper towel, dip in oil, and use tongs to rub the folded up
  paper towel on the grill grates.)


  4 Place fillets skinless side down on the hot grill: Place salmon fillets on grill,
  skinless side down (skin-side up) first, so that the fillets can get nice grill
  marks on the hot grill while the fish is still firm. Close the grill lid. Cook 1
  to 3 minutes on the first side, depending on how thick the fillets are.


  Once the fish fillets have been placed on the grill, do not move them until you
  are going to flip them over. Otherwise, they may fall apart.


  5 Turn fillets over to grill skin-side down: Look for grill marks on the fish and
  a small layer of opaque (cooked) fish where the fish is closes to the grill. Using
  tongs, and a metal spatula to help if necessary, carefully turn the fish onto the
  other side, so that the skin side is now on the grill grates.


  If you are using a charcoal grill, the fillets should be placed on the side of the
  grill furthest from the coals. If you are using a gas grill, just reduce the flame
  to medium.


  Close the grill lid. Cook for another 2-5 minutes, again depending on the thickness
  of the fillets. Salmon should be just barely opaque throughout when done.


  Better to err on the side of undercooking the salmon, rather than overcooking. You
  can always put the fish back on the grill, but once a good fillet is overcooked,
  there''s nothing you can do.


  Remove from grill and serve immediately.'
