directions: 'For the marinade: In a mixing bowl whisk together all marinade ingredients.


  For the kebabs: place steak into a gallon size resealable bag. Pour marinade over
  steak then seal bag while pressing out excess air and message marinade over steak.
  Transfer to refrigerator and allow to marinate 3 - 6 hours.


  Preheat a grill over medium-high heat to about 425 degrees (partway through preheating
  clean grill grates if they aren''t already clean).


  With veggies on cutting board, drizzle with oil and lightly toss to coat (I actually
  don''t toss the onion because I like it to stay in chunks, when you thread the onion
  on layer in chunks about 2 - 3 slices so they don''t burn up).


  Sprinkle veggies evenly with garlic powder and season with salt and pepper. To assemble
  kebabs layer steak and veggies onto kebabs in desired order, work to fit 4 steak
  pieces onto each kebab (I like to layer 2 onion slices together).


  Brush grill grates lightly with oil. Place kebabs on grill and grill until center
  of steak registers about 140 - 145 degrees for medium doneness, turning kebabs occasionally,
  about 8 - 9 minutes. Serve warm.'
