directions: 'Put the 3 cups flour, yeast, 2 teaspoons salt and 2 tablespoons of the
  olive oil in a food processor. Turn the machine on and add 1 cup water through the
  feed tube. Process until the mixture forms a slightly sticky ball, about 30 seconds.
  If the mixture is too dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time and process for
  5 to 10 seconds after each addition. If the mixture refuses to come together, add
  more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and process until it does.


  Rub a little olive oil or sprinkle a little flour onto your hands and shape the
  dough into a ball; wrap in plastic. Let rest at room temperature until the dough
  doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours. Or, if time is tight, let it rest at least 20 minutes
  before proceeding. Or refrigerate for several hours, deflating if necessary if it
  threatens to burst the plastic. (Or divide in half, wrap each ball in plastic, slip
  into a plastic bag and freeze.) Let it return to room temperature before proceeding.


  Reshape the dough into a ball and cut in half, forming 2 balls. (From here on, use
  olive oil if you''re cooking on baking sheets, flour if on a pizza stone.) Put them
  on a lightly floured surface (a pizza peel is ideal), sprinkle with flour and cover
  with plastic wrap; or brush then with a bit of oil and place on a lightly oiled
  sheet. Let rest for about 20 minutes, while you heat the oven to 500 degrees.


  Press a dough ball into a 1/2-inch-thick flat round, adding flour or oil to the
  work surface as necessary. Press or roll the dough until it''s as thin as you can
  make it; let it rest a bit if it becomes too elastic. (Patience is your friend here.)
  You can do two baking sheets at once, or one after another, as you''ll have to if
  using a peel. If doing the latter, slide the dough from the peel onto the stone.


  Sprinkle the pizzas with olive oil (just a little), salt and rosemary. Bake for
  at least 10 minutes, perhaps rotating once, until the crust is crisp. Serve hot,
  warm or at room temperature.'
