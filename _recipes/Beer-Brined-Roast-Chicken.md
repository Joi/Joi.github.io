Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roast whole (thawed) chickens for 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes.
It was salty - maybe I left some brine inside of the bird.
Also, the vegetables burned when I put it on the bottom of the oven as suggested so should be on the lower rack, not bottom of oven.
