directions: 'COOK SHRIMP


  Pat the shrimp dry then season with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and fresh ground black
  pepper.


  Use a microplane to zest the lime and set aside. Cut the zested lime in half ready
  for the sauce later in the recipe.


  Add one tablespoon of the butter to a wide skillet. Save the remaining two tablespoons
  for later.


  Place the skillet with butter over medium heat then add the garlic and coriander.
  Stir the garlic around the pan until the butter melts and is bubbling; about 1 minute.


  Add the shrimp, nestling them into the pan so that they are in one layer. A few
  shrimp stacked on top of each other is okay. Cook until the shrimp start to turn
  pink, about 1 minute.


  Stir in the scallions and lime zest. Continue to cook, stirring, until the shrimp
  are firm and opaque throughout; another 1 to 2 minutes. Slide the skillet off of
  the heat.


  MAKE BUTTER SAUCE


  With the skillet off of the heat, add the cilantro, juice from the lime and the
  remaining two tablespoons of butter. Stir the butter around the pan so that it melts
  into the lime juice making the creamy butter sauce.


  Taste then season as needed with salt and pepper. Serve with extra lime wedges on
  the side.'
