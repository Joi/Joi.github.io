directions: '1. Crush Garlic


  Place the garlic in a blender and give it a quick pulse to lightly crush it or crush
  the garlic in a mortar. It should be very chunky.


  2. Season Chicken


  Place chicken in a bowl. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix well to ensure the seasoning gets all over the
  chicken.


  3. Add Buttermilk and Garlic


  Add the buttermilk and crushed garlic to the bowl with the chicken. Mix lightly
  so the buttermilk and garlic are well distributed.


  4. Let Chicken Marinate


  Cover the bowl of chicken with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator to marinate
  for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.


  7. Coat Chicken with Breading


  Lift a piece of chicken from the buttermilk and shake so the excess buttermilk drips
  off. Place the chicken in the bowl with the breading. Press the breading onto the
  chicken and completely coat the chicken with the breading.


  8. Transfer Chicken to Rack


  Note: For this stage it is best to use a baking sheet with an oven-safe rack that
  fits into the sheet. Or you could just place the chicken on a baking sheet lined
  with aluminum foil and sprayed with oil. Cover baking sheet with aluminum foil for
  easy clean up. Fit an oven-safe rack over the baking sheet. Brush oil over the rack
  or spray the rack with oil. Place breaded chicken pieces on the rack.


  9. Cook Chicken


  Insert probe into the thickest part of the chicken and cook until the probe reads
  160 degrees Fahrenheit. It takes about 17 minutes.


  10. Brush Chicken With Butter


  Remove chicken from oven then brush 2 tablespoons of melted butter all over the
  chicken making sure to brush the areas where the flour is still white.


  11. Crisp Chicken


  Alllow oven to preheat then place chicken back into oven and let it cook until golden
  brown on top. It takes about 10 minutes.


  12. Serve


  Serve the oven fried chicken with coleslaw and biscuits or mac and cheese.'
