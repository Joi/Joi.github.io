Pork Roast: You can use a pork butt, sometimes referred to as pork shoulder roast, or a pork loin. For really tender, flavorful pulled pork, pork butt is best, as it is super marbled with fat and will get really tender. A pork loin won't be as tender, but much less fatty and still delicious.

Apple Juice--beer or stock can be substituted, but the apple juice adds just the right sweetness.

Apple Cider Vinegar--red wine vinegar can be used if you do not have apple cider vinegar.

Honey--feel free to use brown sugar in place of honey.

Storing Leftovers: Leftover pulled pork can be refrigerated for up to 4 days in the refrigerator or frozen for up to 3 months.
