directions: 'In a small bowl, mix together the salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion
  powder, pepper, and chili powder.


  Remove pork roast from packaging and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the spice mixture
  all over the pork roast.


  Lay out the diced onion on the bottom of the slow cooker and then place the seasoned
  pork on top of the onion.


  Combine the juice, vinegar, honey, and tomato sauce and pour over the pork loin.


  Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours.


  Remove the pork roast from the slow cooker and place into a large bowl. Shred the
  pork loin with 2 forks or a kitchen mixer.


  Strain cooking sauce over a large bowl to remove onions. If you want to strain off
  the fat that accumulated prior to pouring liquid over pork, simple place liquid
  in the freezer for 5-10 minutes, then scoop the solidified fat off the liquid before
  thickening.


  If you would like to thicken the barbecue sauce, turn the slow cooker to high and
  cook the sauce for 30 minutes.


  Return the meat back to the slow cooker to stir into the juices.


  Serve on a bun with or without coleslaw, in a lettuce wrap, on a pizza.'

  ingredients: '<ul>

    <li>3-4 lbs boneless pork shoulder roast (pork butt) or pork loin</li>

    <li>1 onion diced</li>

    <li>2 tsp salt</li>

    <li>2 tbs paprika</li>

    <li>1 tbs onion powder</li>

    <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>

    <li>2 tsp pepper</li>

    <li>1 tbs chili powder</li>

    <li>1 cup apple juice or chicken stock or beer</li>

    <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar or red wine vinegar</li>

    <li>1/4 cup honey or brown sugar</li>

    <li>1 8 ounce can tomato sauce</li>

    </ul>

    '
  notes: '<p>Pork Roast: You can use a pork butt, sometimes referred to as pork shoulder
    roast, or a pork loin. For really tender, flavorful pulled pork, pork butt is
    best, as it is super marbled with fat and will get really tender. A pork loin
    won''t be as tender, but much less fatty and still delicious.</p>

    <p>Apple Juice--beer or stock can be substituted, but the apple juice adds just
    the right sweetness.</p>

    <p>Apple Cider Vinegar--red wine vinegar can be used if you do not have apple
    cider vinegar.</p>

    <p>Honey--feel free to use brown sugar in place of honey.</p>

    <p>Storing Leftovers: Leftover pulled pork can be refrigerated for up to 4 days
    in the refrigerator or frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
