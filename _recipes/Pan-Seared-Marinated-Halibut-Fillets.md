directions: 'In a large sealable plastic bag, combine the 6 tablespoons olive oil,
  garlic, basil, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Add fish, seal bag, and turn to coat.
  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.


  In a large flat skillet (do not use a ridged pan), pour light olive oil or vegetable
  oil, tilting pan to spread evenly. Warm over high heat until smoking, then add fish
  fillets. Brush top and sides with marinade. Cook until seared, about 3 minutes;
  turn and sear other side, about 3 more minutes. Brush top and sides with marinade
  again. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until centers of fillets are just opaque, 2 to
  4 minutes more on each side depending on thickness, brushing with marinade as before.
  Garnish with parsley, if desired, and serve.'
