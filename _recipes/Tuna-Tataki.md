If you want to add a little more of a kick, you can add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce. You can also add sliced jalepe√±os when you decorate. Typically a ponzu like this would also include dashi and/or dried bonito flakes for more umami flavor - feel free to add a small pinch.

To get a little more citrus flavor, you can rest the tuna on slices of lemon rather than just to decorate the plate.
