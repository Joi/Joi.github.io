directions: 'In a small bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame
  oil, garlic, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Whisk until smooth. Set aside.


  Remove the small side muscle from the scallops, rinse with cold water and thoroughly
  pat dry.This is extremely important to ensure the scallops are dry to get a good
  sear on them!


  Preheat a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add coconut oil. Once pan is hot,
  add scallops, season with black pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes, until golden brown.
  Flip with spatula or tongs. Season with black pepper again and cook 3-4 minutes.
  Add sauce to scallops and let cook another 3 minutes, until sauce has thickened
  and until scallops are cooked through.


  Add scallops to serving plate, drizzle with soy-balsamic glaze and garnish with
  cilantro! Devour.'
