directions: "Make the rub\n\nCombine all the ingredients. Mix well and take a taste.\
  \ If it needs more salt, shake some in. The rub can be stored in an airtight container\
  \ for up to several weeks. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.\n\nPrepare the ribs\n\nPeel the\
  \ membrane off the back side of the ribs and discard it. (It tends to be sort of\
  \ slippery. If you have a hard time getting a grip, try grabbing it with a paper\
  \ towel and see if that helps.) Season the ribs liberally on both sides with some\
  \ of the rub.\n\nPrepare the grill for cooking over indirect heat at 250\xB0 F (121\xB0\
  C) using oak or hickory wood. Place the ribs, meaty side up, directly on the grill\
  \ grate. Cook for 2 1/2 hours, maintaining the temperature of the grill as steady\
  \ as possible.\n\nFlip the ribs and cook for 30 minutes more.\n\nPlace a double\
  \ layer of some big sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil next to the grill and place\
  \ the ribs on the foil, meaty-side up. Wrap the ribs, sealing the package tightly.\
  \ Place the foil-wrapped ribs on the grill for 1 hour. (Wrapping the ribs in foil\
  \ is essential to get them tender so do not omit this step. If you\u2019re the adventurous\
  \ type, add a half cup of strongly brewed coffee to the foil package when you wrap\
  \ the ribs.)\n\nTransfer the foil-wrapped ribs to a platter. Increase the temperature\
  \ of the grill to 400\xB0F (204\xB0C). Remove the ribs from the foil, place them\
  \ on the grill grate, and brush with the barbecue sauce. Cook for 5 to 15 minutes,\
  \ depending on how charred you like your ribs.\n\nFlip the ribs, brush with the\
  \ sauce again, and cook for 5 to 15 minutes more.\n\nPlace the ribs on a platter\
  \ and serve with additional barbecue sauce, preferably warm, on the side. Originally\
  \ published August 30, 2010."
