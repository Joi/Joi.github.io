directions: 'Combine paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper in bowl. Pat drumsticks dry
  with paper towels. Using metal skewer, poke 10 to 15 holes in skin of each drumstick.
  Rub with oil and sprinkle evenly with spice mixture.


  Arrange drumsticks in air-fryer basket, spaced evenly apart, alternating ends. Place
  basket in air fryer and set temperature to 400 degrees. Cook until chicken is crisp
  and registers 195 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes, flipping and rotating chicken halfway
  through cooking. Transfer chicken to large plate, tent loosely with aluminum foil,
  and let rest for 5 minutes.


  Meanwhile, microwave hot sauce, butter, molasses, and cornstarch in large bowl,
  stirring occasionally, until hot, about 1 minute. Add chicken and toss to coat.
  Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with blue cheese. Serve.'
