directions: 'Remove alternating stripes of peel on cucumbers and trim ends. Dice cucumbers
  into 1/4-inch pieces and place in a large bowl with onion and fresh herbs. Using
  your fingers to break up any large pieces, gently grind the dried mint into the
  bowl. Remove tomato cores, dice remaining tomatoes into 1/4-inch pieces and add
  to bowl.


  In a small bowl, make a vinaigrette by whisking together 1/4 cup lime juice, oil,
  3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Just before serving, dress vegetables
  with vinaigrette and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and lime
  juice as needed. This salad should be bright, crunchy and tart, a nice counterpoint
  for rich, buttery rice and unctuous stews. Serve at room temperature or lightly
  chilled. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for up to 2 days.'
