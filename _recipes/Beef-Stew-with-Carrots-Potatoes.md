directions: "Preheat the oven to 325\xB0F and set a rack in the lower middle position.\n\
  \nPat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or\
  \ heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until\
  \ hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about\
  \ 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the\
  \ meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust\
  \ before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.\n\
  \nAdd the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon\
  \ and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the\
  \ tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to\
  \ the pan and sprinkle with the flour. Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is\
  \ dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and\
  \ sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the\
  \ pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven,\
  \ and braise for 2 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven and add the carrots and\
  \ potatoes. Cover and place back in oven for about an hour more, or until the vegetables\
  \ are cooked, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. Fish out the bay leaf\
  \ and discard, then taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve the stew warm\
  \ -- or let it come to room temperature and then store in the refrigerator overnight\
  \ or until ready to serve. This stew improves in flavor if made at least 1 day ahead.\
  \ Reheat, covered, over medium heat or in a 350\xB0F oven. Garnish with fresh parsley,\
  \ if desired.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The stew can be frozen for up to\
  \ 3 months. Just omit the potatoes because they don\u2019t freeze well. If you\u2019\
  d like, boil some potatoes separately when you defrost the stew and either add them\
  \ into the stew or serve them on the side. Before serving, defrost the stew in the\
  \ refrigerator for 24 hours and then reheat on the stovetop over medium-low heat\
  \ until hot."
