directions: "Using sturdy kitchen shears, cut the chicken along both sides of the\
  \ backbone. Flip the chicken to breast side up and press firmly to open fully. This\
  \ is called spatchcocking a chicken and this video shows you the process.\n\nSet\
  \ the backbone aside in the freezer for your next chicken stock.\n\nIn a small bowl,\
  \ mix the salt, herbs, cumin and 2 tablespoons olive oil, and apply on the entire\
  \ skin surface of the chicken. (It's easiest to do this with your hands; wash them\
  \ meticulously before and after.) If there is time, cover with plastic wrap and\
  \ allow to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or, better yet, overnight.\n\n\
  Preheat the oven to 260\xB0C (450\xB0F).\n\nPlace a cast iron skillet (see details\
  \ in the post above) over medium heat. When it is hot enough that a drop of water\
  \ sizzles, pour in 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the garlic and let it steep in the\
  \ oil for 30 seconds.\n\nPush the garlic to the sides and place the chicken in the\
  \ pan skin side down.\n\nPlace the weight of your choice (a brick, another pan,\
  \ or a cast iron lid; see details in the post above) on the chicken and press firmly\
  \ so the chicken skin is as much in contact with the pan as possible. Cook undisturbed\
  \ for 5 minutes.\n\nProtecting your hands with oven mitts (I love my Ove' Gloves),\
  \ transfer the whole thing with great care (pan + weight + chicken = hot + heavy!)\
  \ into the oven and roast for 15 minutes.\n\nTake the whole thing out (again, with\
  \ great care), remove the weight and flip the chicken in the pan so it is now skin\
  \ side up.\n\nReturn to the oven for 15 minutes (without the weight this time),\
  \ until the chicken skin is nicely colored and the chicken is fully cooked. (If\
  \ you have a food thermometer with a probe, insert it into the fleshy part of the\
  \ thigh and check that it has reached 74\xB0C/165\xB0F.)\n\nCarve the chicken and\
  \ serve with the juice and garlic cloves, and perhaps perfect mashed potatoes and\
  \ green beans on the side."
