directions: 'Shell the shrimp and put the shells in a stockpot. Put the shrimp in
  a mound on a large plate. Slice the squid and place in a mound next to the shrimp.
  Cut the remaining fish into one-and-a-half-inch chunks and put any bones into the
  stockpot. Squeeze lemon juice onto the fish and set aside.


  Add the parsley to the stockpot with any fish heads and other bones. Add five cups
  water and simmer gently uncovered for 30 minutes.


  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and soften the leek with the carrots and the
  garlic. Add the tomatoes with the saffron and white wine. Cook gently for five minutes,
  turn heat down to very low, cover and simmer while the broth is cooking.


  Meanwhile, make the rouille. Put the bread and mayonnaise into the bowl of a food
  processor. Add the mayonnaise, paprika and cayenne. Slowly add the oil and process
  until you have a thick puree. Season to taste and place in a small bowl.


  Drain the fish broth and reserve. Put the broth into a pot that you can carry to
  the table and add the leek tomato mixture. Simmer for five minutes.


  Just before serving add the fish to the broth. First add the squid, cook for five
  minutes, then add the white fish, cook for two minutes, then add the shrimp and
  cook for two minutes. Bring to the table and serve the rouille separately.'
