directions: 'In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.


  In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm
  tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with
  your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest
  for 15 minutes.


  Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a
  ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest
  and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator.
  (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape
  it for pizza.)


  To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers
  to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.'
