During the COVID-19 lockdown, I have started cooking a lot more - almost every dinner. While planning my cooking, I decided to organize my recipes. I noticed that the app that I was using, [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/), could export to html so I set up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and had GitHub serve the site. I thought that this would be a good GitHub project to become more familiar with GitHub as well.

Boris Anthony who has worked with me on my website since the beginning is now helping me with this.

As I've continued to cook and read books like [Salt Fat Acid Heat by Samin Nosrat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/), [The Food Lab by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/), and [Modernist Cuisine at Home by Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoya](https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/), I realized that it wasn't so much about recipes and that the underlying theory and the practical experience were super important. I've added [Project Smoke by Steven Raichlen](https://www.stevenraichlen.com/programs/project-smoke/), [Ad Hoc at Home by Thomas Keller](https://www.thomaskeller.com/ad-hoc-home),  [The Zuni Cafe Cookbook by Judy Rodgers](https://wwnorton.com/books/The-Zuni-Cafe-Cookbook/) and [The Flavor Equation by Nik Sharma](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1452182698/) to my kitchen. I also read many blogs and recipe site.

I have pages for recipes that I like on other sites. I list the ingredients and provide a link to the original recipes where you can see the complete instructions. I also have the full instructions on recipes that I have created or rewritten and customized.

I've also started to create some basic guides as references for my cooking.

* [[Knowledge and Task Management]]

All of the five star recipes below are recipes that I've tried and like.
