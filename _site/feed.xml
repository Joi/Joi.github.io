&lt;p&gt;Lasagna used to be an old favorite to make, but I haven’t made it in quite awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to do some research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some recipes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cafedelites.com/best-lasagna/&quot;&gt;A nice recipe that basically replaces ricotta cheese with Béchamel&lt;/a&gt; - Maybe I’ll make this my base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23600/worlds-best-lasagna/&quot;&gt;A recipe that boasts being the best. Uses Italian sausage and takes 3 1/4 hours&lt;/a&gt; - It looks like 1 1/2 hour of it is making the meat sauce. Maybe I can use the pressure cooker pattern from the pressure cooker Ragú recipe to shorten that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/lasagna/&quot;&gt;More spices and bell peppers as well as wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-homemade-lasagna/&quot;&gt;Nice simple recipe with good tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now working on [[Jois-Lasagna|my own recipe]] based on these.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe" /><summary type="html">I had a request for lasagna from the family with the constraint that one of the diners didn’t like ricotta cheese.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">BBQ Whole Chicken</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/05/bbq-whole-chicken" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BBQ Whole Chicken" /><published>2020-09-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/09/05/BBQ-Whole-Chicken</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/05/bbq-whole-chicken"></content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Brisket Recipe Roundup</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/04/brisket-recipe-roundup" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brisket Recipe Roundup" /><published>2020-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/09/04/Brisket-Recipe-Roundup</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/04/brisket-recipe-roundup">&lt;p&gt;Lately, kind of like the way that Nosrat describes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/&quot;&gt;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started googling and reading lots of recipes around an ingredient or a dish to look for underlying patterns to get a sense of the dish first. Then I think about the diners, the ingredients that I have and what I think I have the time and energy to do. Finally, I pick a “base” recipe and modify it based on input from various other recipes to come up with the plan for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take notes and then try to experiment and iterate to refine “my” recipe. The current note taking and knowledge management system isn’t perfect for this. Currently, I have recipes and posts. Recipes are either authored or downloaded and are sort of snapshots of a recipe. Posts are delineated by date and have tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipes aren’t dynamic enough - I feel like I should be taking notes and documenting stuff right in the recipes - for instance, having a master recipe for roast brisket with links to other recipes, notes from experiments and underlying sub-recipes and ideas such as [[2020-08-02-reverse-sear|Reverse Sear]].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the dates on the posts are slightly problematic. Do I use the date that I did the cooking? Do I use the date that I’m writing the thing? What if a particular project, like my brisket project, take more than one day? Do I break it up into daily updates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have the same problem when I’m just note taking in &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, which is what I’m using to author right now. Do I make a single document for a topic or do I make a document for each meeting and scatter thoughts about a topic across multiple documents and link them with hashtags and links?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to brisket. I’m going to start googling recipes and park them here for now… but I’m not going to cook the brisket until Sunday or Monday. But the 5 lb brisket I ordered from Savenor’s is coming on Sunday. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading some of the recipes, I realized that I need to decide whether this will be a one day affair or a two day affair.

&lt;p&gt;As more and more of my cooking becomes elaborate, the recipes that I’m excited about increasingly involve slow cooking. I’ve tried to figure out ways to monitor temperature remotely and otherwise figure out how to do slow cooks during a working day, but it’s been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played with the pressure cooker a bit early on, but I decided to give it another go to see if I can compress the cooking times on some things that I would normally leave for the weekend or try to mash into a week day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I tried two dishes that I would normally have not used a pressure cooker for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was the [[Bolognese-Sauce-Recipe-Instant-Pot]] yesterday. When making Ragu/Bolognese, I traditionally used [[Ragu-Bolognese|a recipe]] from Harry’s Bar Cookbook and cooked it for several hours instead of the 1 hour in the recipe. The Instant Pot recipe wasn’t as good as the slow cooked Ragu, but it was quite good and much better than just quick meat sauce without the simmering - the meat was softer, the sauce creamier and the veggies very soft. I think next time, I’ll try sticking the veggies in the Thermomix to see if I can get the &lt;em&gt;soffrito&lt;/em&gt; to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I tried making Beef Back Ribs using an [[Instant-Pot-Beef-Back-Ribs|Instant Pot recipe]]. The recipe involves blasting the ribs in the Instant Pot pressure cooker with apple cider vinegar after a few hours in the fridge with a spice rub. Then, the ribs go into the oven at high heat after basting with BBQ sauce to get a crunchy skin. Again, they didn’t come out tasting like they were slow cooked - indeed they looked and tasted like pressure cooked and then seared ribs, but they were pretty good nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to keep experimenting and I’m excited to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524762962/&quot;&gt;Dinner in an Instant&lt;/a&gt; by Melissa Clark that Adam recommended to look for some other tips. My current thinking is that the pressure cooker is definitely better than doing these things quickly without the pressure cooker, but I still prefer the slow cooking if I have time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe," /><category term="pressure-cooker" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My first Prime Rib</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/17/prime-rib" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My first Prime Rib" /><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/17/prime-rib</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/17/prime-rib">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recipes/1FA70E5D-F935-4CF0-A888-E3BA23727406-2241-0001DD41E9775259/345B6076-40B7-4425-8C42-7C3059EEDA67-2241-0001DD4817BFB668.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prime Rib on plate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using what I learned about [[2020-08-12-reverse-sear-redux|reverse sear]], I took on the challenge of making my first Prime Rib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recipes/1FA70E5D-F935-4CF0-A888-E3BA23727406-2241-0001DD41E9775259/4E8B3C39-9821-47FF-B8AB-16F762165011-2241-0001DD4C761C2BE8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dry Brining&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I dry brined the meat for a day and a half with salt and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recipes/1FA70E5D-F935-4CF0-A888-E3BA23727406-2241-0001DD41E9775259/55B7187E-A264-47D2-9D28-E1039E5BB1F3-2241-0001DD4B012AF508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prime Rib with thermometer&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I then roasted it in the oven on a rack at 170ºF for almost 5 hours. My target temperature was 130ºF, which is medium-rare and according to Kenji Lopez-Alt, the best target for a tender and tasty Prime Rib. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recipes/1FA70E5D-F935-4CF0-A888-E3BA23727406-2241-0001DD41E9775259/1887EE7F-8647-4A14-8DFF-8DDD73E37A85-2241-0001DD4D05BDE2DB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Resting Prime Rib&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then, I rested the the meat for about 45 min and then seared it for about 8 min.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Prime Rib August 17, 2020&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This time, luckily, I guessed the time right, but according to Kenji Lopez-Alt, if your Prime Rib is finished early, you can pull it when it gets to the target temperature and then put it in for 45 min at 200ºF to reheat before the sear.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can rest the Prime Rib for 30 min to 1 ½ hours so the only reason to pull it early would be if it completed more than 1 ½ hours before serving.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rev-sear-board.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Reverse Sear Cutting Board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rev-sear-plated.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Reverse Sear Plated&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did a [[2020-08-02-reverse-sear|reverse sear]] again. This time, the steak from Savenor’s was 2 inches, 1/2 inch thicker than the last time. I wanted to leave plenty of time to cook the steaks so I stuck them into the oven set to 170ºF. I used a remote temperature monitor to track the temperature from my office while it cooked and I kept an eye on my estimated finish time that I calculated by estimating the degrees per minute that it was heating up at each measurement and extrapolating it to my “pull temperature” of 122ºF for a medium-rare doneness after searing and resting - 135ºF serving temperature target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 3:43PM, I realized that my steak was going to arrive an hour early at this rate - I was trying to finish at 5:30PM pull for a 5:45PM sear completion with 15 min for resting, slicing an serving - 6PM serve time. I turned off the oven, but kept the steak in the slowly cooling oven. Because of the residual heat in the oven and the hotter parts of the steak heating the center (where my thermometer was placed), the temperature continued to climb, but slower and slower. At 5:06PM, my oven temperature was 118ºF and I was down to 0.1ºF / min heating so I turned the oven back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5:46PM, I hit 122ºF, pulled the steak, seared it on a cast iron skillet and let it rest on the cutting board for 10 min. I then sliced the steak and served. It turned out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to improve my calculation for time in the oven, although this thing with turning off the oven seems to work. I also noticed, again, that with my thermometer near the center of the steak pressed against the bone measured a temperature about 4ºF warmer than the center of the colder steak. I wonder what the best way is to guess the coldest part of the steak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese eat salmon, but my theory is that because it comes from Hokkaido in the far north, Tokyo people never had fresh salmon. Japanese eat salmon heavily salted or cured and cooked well done. It wasn’t until recently that Japanese ate raw salmon and many sushi places still put raw salmon in the “eww” category along with other American sushi innovations like mayonnaise and avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also see people from Nordic regions eating salmon very rare too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, who is very Japanese, always finds my American influenced salmon recipes to be way to soft and rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, especially the Pacific Northwest, people eat salmon very rare. Nathan Myhrvold, who hails from Seattle, tell us in &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/&quot;&gt;Modernist Cuisine&lt;/a&gt; to pull it from the sous vide at 113ºF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Pan-Seared-Salmon-Fillets-with-Crispy-Skin|Kenji López-Alt says]] that rare should be 110ºF, medium-rare 120ºF and 130ºF for medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that today I’ll try cooking the salmon to 130ºF using what [[Pan-Seared-Salmon-Fillets-with-Crispy-Skin|Kenji López-Alt says]]  for grilling and making the salmon and some [[Grilled-Salmon-with-Cilantro-Pecan-Pesto|cilantro pesto]] on the side for the adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Better Mac and Cheese through Chemistry</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/10/better-mac-and-cheese-through-chemistry" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Better Mac and Cheese through Chemistry" /><published>2020-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/10/better-mac-and-cheese-through-chemistry</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/10/better-mac-and-cheese-through-chemistry">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mac-and-cheese.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;mac-and-cheese&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that have been challenging is finding good things for may 3 year old to eat that we can make. One thing that she likes is Annie’s Mac &amp;amp; Cheese. Annie’s boast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made with Goodness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made with organic pasta&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made with 100% real cheese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheese from cows not treated with rBST (no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non rBST-treated cows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work with trusted suppliers to source only non-GMO ingredients&lt;br /&gt;
No artificial flavors, synthetic colors, or synthetic preservatives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried making Mac &amp;amp; Cheese before from various recipes but my daughter didn’t eat it. Also, I found that my Mac &amp;amp; Cheese didn’t keep in the fridge very well - the cheese got hard and the oil separated from the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cheese-and-emulsifier.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Cheese and Emulsifier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read Modernist Cuisine where they used Sodium Citrate as an emulsifier.[[An emulsifier is a substance that allows oil to be suspended in water or water-based liquids as an emulsion. Eggs, for example, have a natural emulsifier that allows them to be fatty but liquid and mixed together with the water-based part of the egg. The emulsifier in eggs is what allows the oil and vinegar in mayonnaise to be mixed together.::rsn]]They described how this would allow the cheese to become silky smooth - the texture of Annie’s. Looking at the label on Annie’s, I found that it contained Sodium Phosphate as an emulsifier. I think Sodium Citrate comes from citruses whereas Sodium Phosphate comes from Phosphate mines, which clearly isn’t as “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I’ve been having various arguments with people about what is “healthy.” Minerals and simple common molecules found in the body already clearly aren’t “poison.” Having said that, too much of most things is bad for you. I think that it’s important read the research and be careful of consuming too much of anything, especially if it’s been shown to have adverse health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that molecules designed to kill things like pesticides (bugs), preservatives (microbes), and herbicides (plants) are probably more likely to have adverse side effects than common minerals. Therefore, I agree that the “organic and no preservatives” notations seems helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory that I heard from Albert-László Barabási who is &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodome.co/&quot;&gt;researching food&lt;/a&gt; and the chemistry of food and the body was that most living things have very similar metabolic pathways. In fact, the chemicals that are present in most living things and the amounts of these chemicals tend to be roughly a similar distribution. That means that if you eat whole foods, you tend to have a “natural” distribution of chemicals. However, with processed foods, you can end up ingesting unnatural concentrations of certain molecules that throws your body out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this makes a ton of sense and a good reason to keep an eye on high concentrations of anything, especially if your body doesn’t have a natural or easy way of getting rid of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think the whole “good for you” “bad for you” business is very complicated because we like to have simple and emotional responses to labels, we don’t have time to keep up with studies. Even if we do read studies, science is constantly flip-flopping on what it thinks is good for us or bad for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that the best that we can do is try to focus on whole foods, when ingesting lots of anything, look for the science to see if we should be particularly concerned, and try not to make or eat anything that tastes horrible. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/whisked-cheese.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Whisked Cheese&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Modernist Cuisine recipe said to dissolve the Sodium Citrate in milk or water (I used milk) and then slowly melt/whisk in cheddar cheese until you ended up with a creamy liquid. Then boil the macaroni and fold in the cheese sauce. It worked well and tasted great! My daughter didn’t like it though. I’ll try one more time experimenting with different cheeses and maybe make it more mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do think I got the consistency right. One of the things about Modernist Cuisine is that they use a lot of “chemicals.” Sodium Citrate is one. MSG is another. They also try to “perfect” some of our favorite fast foods like Mac &amp;amp; Cheese and the Big Mac. It’s clearly a different path than the traditionalist cookbooks. I’m enjoying it, but I think I may have lost my wife once plastic bags of white powders with scientific names started showing up on our doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe" /><category term="health" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tuna Confit Redux</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/06/tuna-confit-redux" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tuna Confit Redux" /><published>2020-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/06/tuna-confit-redux</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/06/tuna-confit-redux">&lt;p&gt;I made [[2020-07-03-tuna-confit|tuna confit]] about a month ago and I used the recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/&quot;&gt;Nosrat’s book&lt;/a&gt;. I modified it a bit but it involved using a Dutch oven at 150ºF for about 9 min after preparing oil infused with various aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/&quot;&gt;Modernist Cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to try it again, but with the sous vide instead. The cool thing that I learned from Modernist Cuisine was that I could use glass jars which could be used to refrigerate the tuna after it was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read various recipes that seemed to have different opinions on whether the product of tuna confit specifically and confit in general was pasteurized and could last for months, weeks or just days. I fine Modernist Cuisine to be the most conservative so I’ll go with them - only keep the tuna for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Modernist Cuisine recipe was pretty straight forward - brine the tuna with salt and sugar for 24 hours. Rinse the tuna, put it in jars and sous vide at 124ºF for a hour or so until the internal temperature of the tuna is 122ºF. Modernist Cuisine doesn’t add any flavor to the tuna so I decided to experiment with one jar including oil infused with black peppercorns, garlic and rosemary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tuna came out nice although the surface of the tuna had little “growths” that looked some something in a petri dish - probably the liquid from inside of the tuna seeping out. The aromatics infused oil tasted better than the plain oil. The tuna was a bit salty - it could have been that I used sea salt that had a higher salt density than the kosher salt. I think I’ll try using less salt next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was very nice. I served it with my alioli sauce that went very well with it. I served it for dinner, but I think this tuna is probably a better lunch or breakfast dish - maybe in a sandwich, in a salad or on the side of something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernistcuisine.com/&quot;&gt;Nathan Myhvold’s &lt;em&gt;Modernist Cuisine at Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a beautiful and great book - especially the chemistry and the very “tech” style practical elements such as using emulsifiers for sauces and other more “modern” ingredients and cooking techniques. I got to the chapter on steaks just when my 1.5 inch dry-aged t-bone steaks from Savenor’s were dry-brining in my fridge. Nathan had a number of recommendations including sous vide, slow low-heat oven and BBQ grill with ice pan. I definitely want to try to grill with the pan and I would have gone with sous vide, but my sous vide was being used by the chicken confit… so I decided to go low-heat in the oven. Nathan’s recipe was super low 170ºF or so for 50 min for a 1 inch steak. He said a 2 inch steak could take 3 hours! His recipe called for searing the steak first after a short time in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking around on the Internet and reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/how-to-reverse-sear-best-way-to-cook-steak.html&quot;&gt;Kenji Lopez’s post on reverse sear&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to go low-heat in the oven with a reverse sear rather than a pre-sear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan had the oven at “160ºF or its lowest temperature setting” whereas Kenji sets the temperature at “between 200 and 275ºF” because “many ovens can’t hold temperatures below 200ºF very accurately.” Nathan is clearly more of a hardware snob. My Wolf oven allowed me to set it at 170ºF but the temperature varied widely between 180 and 213ºF at the middle rack on convection bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put my 1.5 day, dry-brined, dry-aged beef on a rack with bone side facing the back of the oven and set the temperature to 170ºF. I stuck the steak in at 3:15PM to give me plenty of time. I stuck a thermometer into the edge of the steak and pushed it to intersect with the bone on the inside in the middle of the steak - the part that I thought would be the coldest when completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 min, the internal temperature of the meat went from 60ºF to 75ºF. 10 min later, it was at 90ºF - in other words, 15ºF / 10 min. At this rate, I would be up to my target 122ªF in less than one hour. I needed to slow down. At 5PM, I cut the oven and my internal temperature was 124ºF. I decided to let it go a bit past my target since the target of 122ºF includes the increase to 133ºF (my favorite medium-rare temp) as I seared the hot steak and the temperature settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5:24PM, the steak was at 128ºF, the oven was 180ºF so I pulled the steak. I jammed my instant thermometer in several places and noticed that it was colder in the middle of the meat than by the bone. Unbelievable! Probably a combination of the bone facing the back of the oven and it sitting there for so long was the cause. In the middle of the meat, I recorded a 119ºF reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the oven to 220ºF and put the steak back in. At 5:35PM I pulled the steak again, this time with recording 122ºF at the coldest spot with my instant thermometer. Interestingly, the smell (probably because there is no sear) of the steak and the oven weren’t really that great - sort of funky actually. I seared it on a cast iron skillet with oil for around 1 min per side, tossing in some butter at the very end. The steak was so dry it barely sizzled, but it seared perfectly - crisp, brown, wonderful smell. I sliced the steak and served it with soy sauce and wasabi. It was a tad over-done. However, was very good and tasted almost like &lt;em&gt;wagyu&lt;/em&gt;. It may have been one of the best steaks I’ve made. I think the very slow cook caused an incredibly complex chemical reaction with the perfect sear at the end. Yum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back of the oven, I had heard, is hotter than the middle. With the convection oven, it might even be amplified if just in front of the vent. Will measure next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse sear works especially well because the surface of the meat was super-dry compared to pre-sear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse sear is more difficult to time than pre-sear because there is more of a range of temperature change after pulling the steak because of the sear. The appropriate temperature to pull the steak is made even more difficult if the temperature of the oven has been changed because the speed of transmission of internal temperature from the outside to the inside is less “known.” However, putting the sear at the end times the sear perfectly before serving vs the pre-sear which probably tastes and smells better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="recipe" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
