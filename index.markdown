title: Joi's GitHub Jekyll Page

During the COVID-19 lockdown, I have started cooking a lot more - almost every dinner. While planning my cooking, I decided to organize my recipes. I noticed that the app that I was using, [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/), could export to html so I set up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and had GitHub serve the site. I thought that this would be a good GitHub project to become more familiar with GitHub as well.

As I've continued to cook and read books like [Salt Fat Acid Heat by Samin Nosrat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) and [The Food Lab by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/), I realized that it wasn't so much about recipes and that the underlying theory and the practical experience were super important. I decided to use the blog posts feature in Jekyll and begin documenting my cooking experiments. I have decided to use the date that the cooking occurred, not when I wrote the post to  keep the posts and my calendar more synced.

I've also started to create some basic guides as references for my cooking.

* [Recipes](food/recipe_list/)
* [Coffee Basics](food/coffee-basics)
* [Common Ingredients by Volume and Mass](food/ingredients-volume-mass)
* [Volume, Weight and Temperature Conversions](food/volume-weight-temp)

{% for recipe in site.recipes %}
    <h2><a href="{{ recipe.url }}">{{ recipe.url }}</a></h2>
{% endfor %}

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{post.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} - {{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
