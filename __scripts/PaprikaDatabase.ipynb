After 30 minutes, transfer to lightly floured counter and roll into 18 by 16-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. Fold upper half of dough over lower half. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). Move ruler to top edge of dough, measure in 1\\u00bd inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). Starting at lower left corner, use sharp pizza wheel or knife to cut dough from mark to mark. You will have 12 triangles and 5 diamonds; discard scraps. Unfold diamonds and cut into 10 triangles (making 22 equal-size triangles in total).\\n\\nPosition 1 triangle on counter. (Keep remaining triangles covered with plastic.) Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of short side of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently, then stretch bottom point. Place triangle on counter so point is facing you. Fold down both sides of slit. Roll top of triangle partway toward point. Gently grasp point with 1 hand and stretch again. Resume rolling, tucking point underneath. Curve ends gently toward each other to create crescent. Repeat with remaining triangles.\\n\\nPlace 12 croissants on 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets at least 21/2 inches apart. Lightly wrap with plastic. Let stand at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 21/2 to 3 hours. (Shaped croissants can be refrigerated for up to 18 hours. Remove from refrigerator to rise and add at least 30 minutes to rising time.)\\n\\nAfter croissants have been rising for 2 hours, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 425 degrees. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and pinch salt. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in oven and reduce temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 12 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack and cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.\\n\\nTO MAKE AHEAD: After shaping, place 10 croissants 1 inch apart on parchment-lined sheet. Wrap with plastic and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Bake frozen croissants as directed from step 8, increasing rising time by 1 to 2 hours.\"\n",

Using your hands or the tip of a knife, lift the triangular piece of shell at the tail of the crab (the apron), break it off, and discard. Pick up the crab with your hands, place a thumb in the hole where the apron was, and pull in one motion to remove the top shell (the carapace) from the rest of the body. Discard the carapace.\\n\\nPlace the crab belly side down on the cutting board with the tail closest to you. Remove and discard the soft, pointy gills from the body. Break off and discard the mouthpiece (the mandibles). Pull away any loose fragments from the body and discard. Rinse away any viscera under cold water.\\n\\nPlace the crab on the cutting board back side up and cut in half from face to tail through the middle of the body. If desired, cut the crab into smaller pieces by slicing between the legs, making sure to cut through the body.\\n\\nTo extract the meat, use seafood crackers or small hammers to crack open the claws, legs, and body. Serve with aioli, melted butter, or cucumber mignonette for dipping.\"\n",

If using bone-in, leave the pork as is, on the bone.\\n\\nSeason the pork. Sprinkle the pork with the salt, pepper, and spices if using. Rub the seasoning into the pork with your fingers so the meat is evenly coated on all sides.\\n\\nSear the pork (optional). If you have time, searing will deepen the final flavor of your pork and give it some textural contrast. Heat a tablepsoon or two of oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the pork and sear on all sides, working in batches as needed so as not to crowd the pan. For more detailed step-by-step instructions, see How To Sear Meat. If not searing, just place the pork in the Dutch oven.\\n\\nAdd the vegetables (if using). Onions, garlic, and other vegetables also deepen the final flavor of the pork, but are optional. If using, nestle them around the pork in the Dutch oven.\\n\\nAdd the liquid. Pour the liquid and liquid smoke (if using) over the pork. The pork should be only partially submerged, with some of the pork remaining above the surface of the liquid.\\n\\nBring to a simmer. Place the Dutch oven with the pork over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer.\\n\\nCover and transfer to the oven. Cover the Dutch oven and transfer the whole pot to the oven.\\n\\nCook for 2 to 4 hours, until fork tender. Let the pork cook undisturbed for 2 hours, then begin checking it every half hour. Total cooking time will be 2 to 4 hours, depending on the amount of pork and whether it's bone-in (which takes longer to cook). The pork is done when it is fork-tender (when the meat can be easily pierced with a fork without resistance and easily falls apart with a little pressure). If you're cooking pork on the bone, the meat should be falling off the bone. If in doubt, cook the meat another half hour; it's almost impossible to overcook meat with this method.\\n\\nTransfer the pork to a large bowl. Lift the pieces of pork out of the liquid and transfer to a large bowl. When cool enough to handle, use two forks or your fingers to shred the meat into pieces. Remove any large pieces of fat or bones.\\n\\nStrain the cooking liquid. Strain the cooking liquid into a measuring cup. The vegetables can be chopped and mixed in with the pork, if desired. Skim the fat off the top of the cooking liquid.\\n\\nMoisten the pork with cooking liquid or barbecue sauce (optional). For more moist and flavorful pulled pork, you can mix some of the cooking liquid back into the pork. Start with a little, mix, then add more until the pork is as wet or dry as you like.

Leaving the steak in the skillet, place it in the oven and allow it to finish cooking, about 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the cut, until the internal temperature reads 120-135 \\u00b0. Allow the meat to rest five minutes before carving and serving.\"\n",

      "        \"2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, cold\\n4 cloves minced garlic\\n2 tablespoons minced onion\\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\\n1 3/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper\\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\\n6 hamburger buns\\nButter for buns\",\n",
      "        \"1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don\\u2019t over handle the meat.\\n\\n2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\\n\\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\\n\\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\\n\\n3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500\\u00b0F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\\n\\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\\n\\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:\\n\\nFor rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125\\u00b0F)\\n\\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135\\u00b0F)\\n\\nFor medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145\\u00b0F)\\n\\nFor well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160\\u00b0F)\\n\\nFlip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.\\n\\n5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.\\n\\n6 Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.\\n\\n7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.\"\n",

      "        \"HERE'S OUR METHOD: If the bread is crusty, briefly pass it under a running faucet of cold water (for softer loaves, skip this step). Wrap the loaf tightly with aluminum foil, place it on the middle rack of a cold oven, and set the temperature to 300 degrees. After about 30 minutes (15 to 20 minutes for small or narrow loaves like baguettes), remove the foil and return the loaf to the oven for about 5 more minutes to crisp up the crust.\\n\\nBut note that because reheating a stale loaf doesn\\u2019t free the starches to move around the way that they can in a just-baked loaf, they recrystallize much more quickly. The effect lasts for only a few hours or so, so make sure to serve or use your revived bread immediately.\"\n",

Add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until you have a wet, sticky dough, about 30 seconds.\\n\\nCover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough has more than doubled in size, 12 to 18 hours.\\n\\nGenerously dust a work surface with flour. Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape the dough onto the surface in 1 piece. Using lightly floured hands or a bowl scraper or spatula, lift the edges of the dough in toward the center. Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round.\\n\\nPlace a clean towel on your work surface and generously dust it with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Gently place the dough on the towel, seam side down. If the dough feels tacky or sticky, dust the top lightly with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour.\\n\\nFold the ends of the tea towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost double in size. When you gently poke the dough with your finger, it should hold the impression. If it springs back, let it rise for another 15 minutes.\\n\\nAbout half an hour before you think the second rise is complete, preheat the oven to 475\\u00b0F (245\\u00b0C). Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and place a 4 1/2-to-5 1/2-quart heavy Dutch oven or pot with a lid in the center of the rack.\\n\\nUsing pot holders, carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven and uncover it. Unfold the tea towel and quickly but gently invert the dough into the pot, seam side up. (Use caution\\u2014the pot will be very hot.) Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes.\\n\\nRemove the lid and continue baking until the loaf is a deep chestnut color but not burnt, 15 to 30 minutes more. The bread is done when it registers 200\\u00b0F to 210\\u00b0F (93\\u00b0C to 99\\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer.\\n\\nUse a heatproof spatula or pot holders to carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool thoroughly.\\n\\nSlice and\\u2026sigh.

      "        \"Detailed measurements and instructions can be found on the printable recipe card at the bottom of the page.\\n\\nForm the dough: In a big bowl mix the flour, salt and yeast together. Pour water into the bowl and using a spatula or a wooden spoon mix it until well incorporated. You do not need to activate the yeast before, even though we\\u2019re using active dry yeast. The slow rising process will do the trick.\\n\\nAllow it to rise: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on your counter or inside your unheated oven for 12 to 18 hours.\\n\\nPreheat your oven: Preheat oven to 450 F degrees. Add your cast iron pot to the oven as it\\u2019s heating and heat it as well until it\\u2019s at 450 F degrees. The pot is hot enough when the oven reaches 450 F degrees. Use oven mitts, as to not burn yourself.\\n\\nShape the dough: Flour your hands really well and also sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough. With your floured hands gently remove the dough from the bowl and roughly shape it into a ball. Take the ball of dough and drop it into the pot. Cover the pot with the lid and place it back in the oven. Alternatively, you can also place the ball of dough onto a piece of parchment paper, then lift the parchment paper and drop it in the pot, with parchment paper and all. This could also ensure that your bread doesn\\u2019t stick at all to the bottom of the pot. I have found that if I use parchment paper, the bread doesn\\u2019t brown so much on the sides, but otherwise it\\u2019s still crusty and delicious.\\n\\nFinish the bread: Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on, after which remove the lid and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. Remove the bread from the pot, it should fall out easily. Let cool completely before slicing into it and serving.\\n\\nSome Tips\\n\\nIf you want to make sure your bread doesn\\u2019t stick to the pot you can sprinkle some flour or cornmeal on the bottom of the pot. Also, as mentioned above you could use parchment paper.\\n\\nDo not refrigerate the dough as it rises, yes it will be safe on your counter for 18 hours.\\n\\nWant an easy way to know if your bread is done? Take the bread out of the Dutch oven, turn it upside down and give the bottom a firm thump with your thumb, or a knock and if it sounds hollow it\\u2019s done.\\n\\nThe slow rise at room temperature is what gives no knead bread its power. I\\u2019ve been asked many times if it needs to sit around for that long and the answer is simply, yes! The yeast needs time to perform its magic.\\n\\nForm the dough: In a big bowl mix the flour, salt and yeast together. Pour water into the bowl and using a spatula or a wooden spoon mix it until well incorporated. You do not need to activate the yeast before, even though we're using active dry yeast. The slow rising process will do the trick.\\n\\nAllow it to rise: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on your counter or inside your unheated oven for 12 to 18 hours.\\n\\nPreheat your oven: Preheat oven to 450 F degrees. Add your cast iron pot to the oven as it's heating and heat it as well until it's at 450 F degrees. Usually when the oven is done preheating your pot should be hot enough as well. Remove the pot from the oven and remove the lid from it. Use oven mitts, as to not burn yourself.\\n\\nShape the dough: Flour your hands really well and also sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough. With your floured hands gently remove the dough from the bowl and roughly shape it into a ball. Sprinkle some extra flour directly into the bottom of the pot.

The long, slow, moist heat of braising is the best way to soften tough cuts of meat.\\n\\nReturn the meat to the pot along with some sort of acidic ingredient like diced tomatoes. The acid helps break down the tough connective tissues in the meat. If you used wine in the previous step, that will work.

You can now add other flavorings and seasonings, like whole peppercorns or bay leaves.\\n\\nBring the braising liquid back to a simmer, then cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and transfer it to the 300 F oven.\\n\\nBraise for 1 to 5 hours, depending on the size of the meat.

Heat to between 140\\u00b0 and 150\\u00b0F, stirring occasionally, and cook for 20 minutes to infuse the flavors of the aromatics into the oil and to pasteurize it for a long shelf life. Taste the oil; it should be slightly salty. Leave to cool and infuse for about 30 minutes; the oil will be warm.\\n\\nPut the pan back over medium-low heat and slip the tuna into the barely warm oil. (Add as many pieces as will fit in one layer. The tuna must be covered by the oil; add more if needed.) Slowly bring the oil to 150\\u00b0F again. Turn off the heat, take the pot from the heat, and let the tuna cook slowly in the warm oil. After a minute or two, test for doneness by breaking into the flake of the tuna. The fish should be cooked to medium rare-slightly pink inside and still tender to the touch. If the tuna isn\\u2019t quite done, return it to the oil for another minute. Repeat with any remaining pieces of tuna.\\n\\nTransfer the tuna to a storage dish (I prefer glass or crockery, but an airtight plastic container will do fine) and let it cool. Let the oil cool separately and then strain the oil over the fish, discarding the aromatics. If the tuna isn\\u2019t completely covered in oil, add more fresh olive oil to the storage dish. If not using right away, cover the container tightly and refrigerate. The tuna will keep, covered in oil and refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.\"\n",

Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, or blond, about 15 minutes. A little browning is fine, but don\\u2019t let the onions burn. If the onions begin to brown too quickly, turn down the heat and add a splash of water. While the onions cook, slice the garlic, then quarter the tomatoes, if using fresh. If using canned, pour them into a large, deep bowl and crush with your hands. Swirl about 1 /4 cup of water in one can, then pour it into the second can and swirl, then add into the tomatoes. Set aside.\\n\\nOnce the onions are soft, push them to the outer edges of the pot and add a spoonful of oil into the center. Add the garlic to the oil. Gently sizzle the garlic until it starts to give off an aroma, about 20 seconds, and before it begins to brown, add the tomatoes. If using fresh tomatoes, use a wooden spoon to smash them a bit and encourage the juice to come out. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Season with salt and tear in basil leaves or add oregano, if using.\\n\\nCook over low heat, stirring the sauce often with a wooden spoon. Scrape the bottom of the pot to ensure that nothing sticks. If the sauce does start to stick and scorch, then do just the opposite. Don\\u2019t stir! That\\u2019ll just mix the burnt taste into the rest of the unaffected sauce. Instead, immediately transfer the sauce to a new pot without scraping the bottom, and leave the scorched pot to soak in the sink. Take extra care to prevent the new pot from burning again.\\n\\nPut a large pot of water on to boil over high heat. Cover with a lid to prevent too much evaporation.\\n\\nThe sauce will be done when its flavor shifts from raw to cooked, about 25 minutes. Dipping your spoon into the sauce, you\\u2019ll be reminded less of the garden or the farmer\\u2019s market and more of a comforting bowl of pasta. If you\\u2019re using canned tomatoes, the shift is subtler: wait for the moment when the tomatoes lose their tinny taste from the can, which can take closer to 40 minutes. When the tomatoes are cooked, bring the sauce to a rapid simmer and stir in 3 /4 cup of olive oil. Let it simmer together for a couple of minutes; the pomarola will transform into a rich sauce as it emulsifies. Remove it from the heat. Pur\\u00e9e the sauce with a stick blender, blender, or food mill, then taste and adjust seasoning. Keep covered in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.

      "        \"BEFORE YOU BEGIN\\nIf braising and serving the ribs on the same day, bypass cooling the ribs in the braising liquid; instead, remove them from the pot straight out of the oven, strain the liquid, then let it settle so that the fat separates to the top. With a wide shallow spoon, skim off as much fat as possible and continue with the recipe. Though this recipe and the one that follows call for widely available English-style short ribs, both recipes will also work with flanken-style short ribs.\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Arrange short ribs bone-side down in single layer in large flameproof roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Roast until meat begins to brown, about 45 minutes; drain off all liquid and fat with bulb baster. Return pan to oven and continue to cook until meat is well browned, 15 to 20 minutes longer. (For flanken-style short ribs, arrange ribs in single layer in large roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Roast until meat begins to brown, about 45 minutes; drain off all liquid and fat with baster. Return pan to oven and continue to cook until browned, about 8 minutes; using tongs, flip each piece and cook until second side is browned, about 8 minutes longer). Transfer ribs to large plate; set aside. Drain off fat to small bowl and reserve. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Place roasting pan on two stovetop burners set at medium heat; add wine and bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon. Set roasting pan with wine aside.\\n\\nHeat 2 tablespoons reserved fat in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; add onions, carrots, and celery. Saut\\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 12 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour until combined, about 45 seconds. Stir in wine from roasting pan, chicken stock, tomatoes, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and add short ribs, completely submerging meat in liquid; return to boil, cover, place in oven, and simmer until ribs are tender, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Transfer pot to wire rack and cool, partially covered, until warm, about 2 hours.\\n\\nTransfer ribs from pot to large plate, removing excess vegetables that may cling to meat; discard loose bones that have fallen away from meat. Strain braising liquid into medium bowl, pressing out liquid from solids; discard solids. Cover ribs and liquid separately with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days.)\\n\\nTo prepare garnish and finish dish: In Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until just crisp, 8 to 10 minutes; remove with slotted spoon to plate lined with paper towel. Add to Dutch oven pearl onions, parsnips, sugar, and salt; increase heat to high and saut\\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Spoon off and discard solidified fat from reserved braising liquid. Add defatted liquid and bring to simmer, stirring occasionally; adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Submerge ribs in liquid, return to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, partially covered, until ribs are heated through and vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer; gently stir in bacon. Divide ribs and sauce among individual bowls, sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon parsley, and serve.\"\n",

      "        \"Frozen Steaks\\nSalt and Pepper\\nOil\",\n",
      "        \"Experiment\\n\\nWe cut a strip loin into eight steaks, cut each steak in half crosswise, put the pieces in vacuum-sealed bags, and froze them. We then thawed half of each steak in the refrigerator overnight and kept the other half frozen. Using our preferred method, we seared both sets of steaks in a hot skillet for 90 seconds per side and then transferred them to a 275-degree oven until they reached 125 degrees, or medium-rare, on an instant-read thermometer. To track moisture loss, we weighed each steak before and after cooking.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nNot surprisingly, the frozen steaks took longer to finish cooking through in the oven (18 to 22 minutes versus 10 to 15 minutes for the thawed steaks). What was surprising was that the frozen steaks actually browned in the skillet just as well as, and in the same amount of time as, the thawed steaks. Furthermore, they had thinner bands of gray, overcooked meat directly under the crust than the thawed steaks had. We also found that these steaks lost on average 9 percent less moisture during cooking than the thawed steaks did. Sampling the steaks side by side, tasters unanimously preferred the cooked-from-frozen steaks to their thawed counterparts.\\n\\nTHE TAKEAWAY\\n\\nWhile we prefer to start with steak that\\u2019s never been frozen for the best texture, if we do have frozen steaks on hand, from now on we\\u2019ll cook them straight from the freezer. Freeze steaks, uncovered, overnight on a baking sheet (this dries them out to prevent excess splattering during cooking), then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, place in a zipper-lock bag, and return to freezer. To ensure that the steaks brown evenly, add oil to the skillet until it measures 1/8 inch deep. And because frozen steaks will splatter more during searing, use a large skillet.\"\n",

Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. And the fish fillets skin side down, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, pressing gently on the back of the fillets with a flexible metal fish spatula to ensure good contact between skin and pan for the first minute. Then continue cooking until the skin has rendered its fat and is crisp, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift the fish with a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.\\n\\r2. Flip the fish and cook on the second side until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\\u00b0F for medium-rare, or 130\\u00b0F for medium, about 1 minute longer. Transfer the fish to a paper-towel-lined plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.\"\n",

Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chickpea skins begin to float to surface and chickpeas are creamy and very soft, 20 to 25 minutes.\\n\\nWhile chickpeas cook, mince garlic using garlic press or rasp-style grater. Measure out 1 tablespoon and set aside; discard remaining garlic. Whisk lemon juice, salt, and reserved garlic together in small bowl and let sit for 10 minutes. Strain garlic-lemon mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.\\n\\nDrain chickpeas in colander and return to saucepan. Fill saucepan with cold water and gently swish chickpeas with your fingers to release skins. Pour off most of water into colander to collect skins, leaving chickpeas behind in saucepan. Repeat filling, swishing, and draining 3 or 4 times until most skins have been removed (this should yield about \\u00be cup skins); discard skins. Transfer chickpeas to colander to drain.\\n\\nSet aside 2 tablespoons whole chickpeas for garnish. Process garlic-lemon mixture, \\u00bc cup water, cumin, and remaining chickpeas in food processor until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add tahini and oil and process until hummus is smooth, creamy, and light, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. (Hummus should have pourable consistency similar to yogurt. If too thick, loosen with water, adding 1 teaspoon at a time.) Season with salt and extra lemon juice to taste.\\n\\nTransfer to serving bowl and sprinkle with parsley, reserved chickpeas, and extra cumin. Drizzle with extra oil and serve. (Hummus can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 5 days. Let sit, covered, at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.)\"\n",

Fill a wok or large pot with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add a teaspoon of oil to the boiling water. Carefully add the fish to the water, piece by piece, working in batches so as not to crowd the pieces. Allow the fish to cook until it has turned opaque, approximately 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Using a skimmer or spider, transfer the fish carefully to a platter to rest.\\n\\nTo finish the dish, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or large skillet set over high heat. When the oil shimmers and is about to smoke, add the scallions, garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or until the mixture is fragrant. Add the mushrooms, and continue to stir-fry for an additional 30 seconds. Stir the sauce mixture, and add it to the wok, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until it has thickened slightly. If it is too thick, thin it out with some of the mushroom-soaking liquid. Add the fish to the wok, and carefully toss until the flesh is coated. Transfer the mixture to a warm platter, and serve immediately.\"\n",
