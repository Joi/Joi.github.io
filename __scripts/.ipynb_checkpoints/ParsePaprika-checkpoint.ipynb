I opted for Noilly Prat because it is a French product in a French dish, but any good quality white vermouth will work. **Dashi-kombu is a seaweed found in Japanese markets and health food stores. Kombu adds an oceanic quality missing if you do not have fish fumet. It also helps to add viscosity to the sauce. ***White pepper will blend into the sauce better, and has a slightly higher pitched flavor/aroma than black pepper, so it is called for here.\n",

      "Always check the expiration date on your yeast and make sure it hasn't expired. All your yeast products whether it’s in a jar or a package should be stamped with a “Best if Used by” date. Always make sure you check this date, even when you purchase the yeast, who knows it could have been on the shelf past its expiry date.\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep your yeast fresh and longer lasting, unopened yeast packages or jars should be stored in a cool or dry place such as your cupboard. However, you can also store your yeast in the fridge or freezer. If you do store it in the freezer and need to use yeast for your baking, make sure you take out the amount you need and let it sit at room temperature for at least half hour before using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your yeast package or jar has been opened, you must refrigerate the yeast or freeze it in an airtight container.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to remember about your yeast, is that it is a living organism and over time it will lose activity, even if you’ve never opened the jar or package. So if you don’t bake often, buy the smaller yeast packages rather than a big jar of yeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is my bread chewy: Usually your bread will be chewy when there isn't enough gluten formation or you're using a low-protein flour. Make sure you let your bread dough rest for at least 12 hours to give it enough time for gluten formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is my bread dense: Usually bread will be too dense when there is too much flour. Keep in mind this dough will be pretty sticky, do not add more flour than specified. Other factors that come into play are humidity and age of flour. Little yeast, long rise, sticky dough are keys to a good, light loaf.\n",

      "I don't have a Dutch oven, what can I use instead: If you don't have a Dutch Oven, a covered metal pot would work as well, just make sure it can stand up to 475 F heat. A 4 quart Calphalon soup pot with lid would work as well. If your pot doesn't have a lid, you can cover the pot with heavy-duty aluminum foil, just make sure you seal the pot well.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I know when my bread is done baking: Tap the bottom! Take the bread out of the Dutch oven, turn it upside down and give the bottom a firm thump with your thumb, or a knock and if it sounds hollow it's done.\n",

I didn't read ahead that the recipe was for a 7lb pork shoulder, so I didn't half the recipe (just the time that I cooked it for). It came out perfectly done, and seasoned. I feel like if I used this on a 7lb pork shoulder that it would come out way under seasoned.
