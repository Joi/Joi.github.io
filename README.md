## To Do
We will flesh out the architecture as we go, figuring out where scripts etc will live in Joi's computer.

- [x] Pseudo-code for Paprika export parser
- [x] Shell script to run parser, Jekyll build and Git commit
- [ ] Figure out a process for getting Paprika exports into the right place for our parser.
- [ ] Test splicing recipe HTML into "Lab Notes" recipe posts from JSON
- [ ] Jekyll templates for rendering the site
